(2 Kings 6:3–4)"},"devotion":{"label":"ಧ್ಯಾನ","text":"When the Lord comes with you, miracles will follow. That’s why, at the beginning of each day, call out to Him: “Lord, as I enter this new day, I want You to come with me!”\r\n\r\nOne of the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please come with your servants.” Elisha answered “I will come”; and he went with them. The Bible says that when they reached the Jordan River, they began cutting down trees with axes.\r\n\r\nThose axes had a wooden handle and an iron blade. The wood symbolized the human nature; the iron, the divine. When Jesus Christ came to this world, He came as both the Son of Man and the Son of God. Therefore, He is able to help us in both our earthly life and our spiritual walk.\r\n\r\nAs one man was chopping a tree, the iron axe head flew off and fell into the water. This doesn’t happen suddenly. Usually, the loosened wedge or pin at the base gives way first. If not fixed, it eventually leads to the full axe head coming off.\r\n\r\nLikewise, a person’s spiritual downfall is not instant. It often begins with neglecting prayer, then skipping Bible reading, then ignoring fellowship. After that, they begin to find fault with God’s servants and eventually end up grumbling against God. In time, their soul sinks deep into spiritual ruin.\r\n\r\nIf only a person recognizes the first signs—the “loosened wedge”—and corrects themselves early, they can avoid a great fall. Many fall away because of carelessness and complacency.\r\n\r\nTo make the lost axe head float again, Elisha needed a stick. This symbolizes Christ—the Branch that sprang from the root of Jesse (Isaiah 11:1). Just as the stick made the sunken iron float, Jesus came to lift souls lost in sin. He was struck and crushed on the cross at Calvary so that we could rise again.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, have you slipped in your spiritual walk? Don’t delay—return to the One who says, “I will come.”"},"conclusion":{"label":"ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಧ್ಯಾನಕ್ಕಾಗಿ","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:10)"]},"author":{"label":"ಲೇಖಕ","author":"ಸ್ಯಾಮ್ ಜೆಬದುರೈ"}}
