Initially, the crows came and brought him food.  And then he was miraculously nourished by a widow.  And thirdly, the angel of God fed him.  How great is the grace of God!\r\n\r\nYou may have heard of Saint Augustine. The moment he was redeemed, he was powerfully transformed into a holy Christian saint. He used to wake up early in the morning every day and would wait at the Lord's feet to pray for grace for that day.\r\n\r\nWhen he walked on the street, after a long time in prayer, people who saw him would repent of their sins and cry out to him.  Even those on the street, would be saved, just by looking at him.  He had so much of the grace of God, upon him.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, \"How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings.\" (Psalm 36:7).  Grace is God's favour to the undeserving. Moments of waiting for His grace are never wasted.  It is in those moments, the Lord will make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\r\n\r\nWe read in the Scripture about Noah finding favour in the eyes of God; about Lot finding favour in the sight of God; about the grace of God upon Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  The reason is that they all waited in the Lord's presence and received graces. The Scripture says, \"For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward those who fear Him.\" (Psalm 103:11)\r\n\r\nTo those who wait at His feet, early in the morning, God pours out His grace like Manna.  \"Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.\" (Lamentations 3:22-23)\r\n\r\nYou should wait in the morning and collect the manna for the day.  Otherwise, it will melt away in the heat of the day.  Likewise, if you do not receive God’s grace in the early hours of the day, then weariness, depression and failure will take hold of you throughout that day.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, you need God's grace to be victorious; to preserve your holiness.  Wait at the Lord's feet and receive grace."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace… grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\" (John 1:16-17)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
