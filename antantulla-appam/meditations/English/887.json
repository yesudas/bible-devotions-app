They never had the authority to command: “Away with you, satan!”. But we read that when David took a harp played it, the presence of God descended upon that place, and the distressing spirit departing from Saul (1 Samuel 16:23).\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, however, there are numerous instances where Lord Jesus stood against satan – the tempter, and commanded: “Away with you, satan!”, and claimed victory. He cast out unclean spirits with ease. There was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way, raise herself up. And when Lord Jesus banished that spirit, she was loosed from her infirmity, and she was made straight. He also cast out deaf and mute spirit, spirit that forced a person into water and fire, and cleansed those who suffered from leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe Lord has given you the anointing and authority through His word. “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:12). Therefore, take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\r\n\r\nNext, you should use the name of the Lord, in order to have victory over your trials. The Lord has promised that: “In My name, the believers will cast out demons” (Mark 16:17). When David went against the Philistine giant, he said: “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied” (1 Samuel 17:45). David used the name of the Lord, as a mighty weapon to slay the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe blood of Jesus, is the other mighty weapon to conquer satan. “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony” (Revelation 12:11). Lord Jesus crushed the head of satan, with the blood of His feet. The Scripture says: “Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,  and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage” (Hebrews 2:14-15).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, do not fear or tremble if there is a spiritual attack in your family. Confront the devil in the mighty name of Lord Jesus. And satan will flee. The Lord has promised that: “No weapon formed against you shall prosper” (Isaiah 54:17). “For there is no sorcery against Jacob, Nor any divination against Israel” (Numbers 23:23)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil” (1 John 3:8)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
