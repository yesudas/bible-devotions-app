Sin grips many people while they are still in their childhood; and they are enslaved in sinful habits; and their whole life is wasted and decayed. But Christian life, is a life of fighting against sin and overcoming it.\r\n\r\nIf you have a question in your mind as to how you can overcome sin, then you should carefully observe as to how Lord Jesus triumphed over sin in his life; and apply those principles in your life. Lord Jesus is the Only One who lived absolutely holy life, and overcame sin. Apostle Peter, the disciple who lived and observed Christ Jesus in close quarters for three and half years, has this to say about the Lord: “He committed no sin; nor was deceit found in his mouth”.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says: “Your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear” (Isaiah 59:2). “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23). “The soul who sins shall die” (Ezekiel 18:20). “He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy” (Proverbs 28:13).\r\n\r\nCarefully observe Lord Jesus! Right from the time of His birth, till He hung on the Cross, to bear the sins of all those who believe, He preserved Himself by committing no sin. And thus, He proved that it is indeed possible to live a holy life here in this world. Sin was not even there in His mind. You also should follow the example of Lord Jesus, and walk in His footsteps. And you can claim that victory and be triumphant in your life.\r\n\r\nHow can a man live without sin? Firstly, he should come unto the Cross of Calvary and confess of all the sins that he has already committed; and obtain the forgiveness of sins from Lord Jesus. He is compassionate and kind to forgive all your sins and remove all your iniquities.\r\n\r\nThe Lord says: “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool”. And once you have honestly confessed of all your sins, you should ask the Lord to fill you with His strength and to help you live a holy life. And the Lord will certainly help you.\r\n\r\nWhen you are filled with the Holy Spirit, He will grant you the power to overcome and be victorious. When you repeatedly confess and declare: “Holy is the Lord”, He Himself will help you to conquer over sins. Children of God, conquer over all sins and march forward in victory."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace” (Romans 6:14)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
