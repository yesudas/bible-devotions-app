This simple act carries a profound lesson for us: when Jesus comes into our lives and homes, we should honour Him and extend our heartfelt hospitality.\r\n\r\nHow can we honour the Lord? The Bible teaches us, “Honor the Lord with your possessions, and with the first fruits of all your increase” (Proverbs 3:9). This is not just a command but an invitation to experience His abundant blessings. The Lord promises, “I will love those who love Me,” and assures us, “He will honour the one who honours Me.” When we honour Him with our first fruits and resources, He blesses us beyond measure: “Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine” (Proverbs 3:10).\r\n\r\nEven if we lack material abundance, we can still honour God with the sacrifice of thanksgiving—a gift that springs from a heart overflowing with love and gratitude. Scripture reminds us that God dwells in the praises of His people. Such offerings of faith and devotion bring joy to the Lord and open the door to His blessings.\r\n\r\nEven when we have little, giving to the Lord is an act of trust and worship. Remember the widow who gave two mites? Jesus commended her because she gave all she had, demonstrating her deep faith and devotion. Likewise, the Lord assures us: “Give, and it will be given to you.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some approach God only to receive, with prayers filled with requests but hearts reluctant to give. Instead, we should approach Him with a spirit of generosity and willingness to honour Him with what we have.\r\n\r\nLook at what happened when the disciples in Emmaus gave bread to Jesus. He didn’t merely eat it. Instead, He took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it back to them. This act reveals a profound truth: whatever we offer to the Lord, He blesses and returns in abundance. When we dedicate our children, time, or resources to His ministry, He multiplies His blessings, enriching our lives through them.\r\n\r\nFaithful giving glorifies God’s ministry and brings peace and fulfilment to our families. When the Lord gives back, He does so generously—opening the windows of heaven and pouring out blessings until there is no room to contain them. Our God is not One who gives sparingly but One who blesses freely, and abundantly."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
