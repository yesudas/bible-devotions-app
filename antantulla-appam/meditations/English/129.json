Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus” (Rev. 22:20).\r\n\r\nToday, all of creation is crying out, “Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus.” The Bride of Christ is longing for His return, calling out, “Make haste, my beloved.” We are living in the last days. The Lord is giving us urgent messages.\r\n\r\nOnce, a king was rushing to his council chamber when a servant ran to him and handed him a letter marked “Important & Urgent.” The king, in his haste, stuffed the letter into his pocket, thinking he would read it later.\r\n\r\nBut do you know what was written in that letter? \"Your Majesty, please do not go to the council hall today. There is a plot to assassinate you.\"\r\n\r\nBecause the king ignored the message, he walked straight into the hands of his enemies, who killed him. Only after his death was the letter retrieved and read. If only he had heeded the warning, he could have been saved!\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the Lord sends us many urgent messages. He is revealing signs that His coming is near. We must not ignore His warnings. The Antichrist is preparing to rise, and the world is racing toward destruction.\r\n\r\nThe time is at hand for the seven bowls of wrath to be poured out, and judgment will soon come upon the earth. The only way to escape is to be ready for the Lord’s return. Since we do not know the day or hour of His coming, we must live in constant preparedness.\r\n\r\n\"Surely I am coming quickly,\" says the Lord (Rev. 22:20).\r\n\r\nMany have grown impatient, discouraged, and even stumbled because the Lord's return seems delayed. Yet, the apostle Paul reminds us: “He who is coming will come and will not delay” (Heb. 10:37). His return is imminent, and He will appear at an unexpected hour.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, the day is near when we will be caught up in the clouds to meet Him. Will you be ready for that moment?"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Be patient, establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near” (James 5:8)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
