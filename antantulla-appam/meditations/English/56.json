Among all the blessings the Lord has given us on this earth, His abiding presence is the greatest privilege.\r\n\r\nIn the divine presence, there is joy and power. The moment we become aware of His presence, we are filled with the confidence and faith that God is truly with us.\r\n\r\nIn the Scriptures, God promises us His presence: “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” This is a precious promise that assures us He will be with us through every season and situation of life.\r\n\r\nNo matter how many challenges or battles you face, the Lord has guaranteed His constant presence. He declares: “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.” (Isaiah 43:2)\r\n\r\nJesus also said, “For where two or three gathered in My name, there am I with them.” (Matthew 18:20) Yes, even if we are not aware, He is standing right beside us. “God did this so that they would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from any one of us.” (Acts 17:27)\r\n\r\nWe don’t need to doubt whether God’s presence will remain with us in the future. He has clearly promised: “Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20)\r\n\r\nMany people do not seek the presence of the Lord. They neither desire it nor understand the blessings that come with it. Even when we disregard or take His presence lightly, God still longs to be with us—because He is loving and gracious.\r\n\r\nJesus says: “Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with Me.” (Revelation 3:20) Dear child of God, He is at the door, longing to be with you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “While we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
