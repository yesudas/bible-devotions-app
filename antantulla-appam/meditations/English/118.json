In this verse, the word serpent symbolizes Satan, and scorpions represent demonic forces.\r\n\r\nMany are tormented by the spirits of serpents, even in their dreams. Whether it's the spirit of a demon or a serpent, take a stand against it using the authority the Lord has given you.\r\n\r\nGod has granted you a threefold blessing — authority, dominion, and power — which are available through three divine sources: the Name of Jesus, the Blood of Christ, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit. If you lay hold of these, you will become stronger than the devil and be equipped to destroy his works.\r\n\r\nHold forth the Blood of Jesus in your hands. Declare, “In the name of Jesus, enemy, I sprinkle fire upon you!” Confront every force—witchcraft, mountains of resistance, demonic powers—saying, “Who are you, O great mountain, before my God? Whoever falls on this Stone will be broken, and on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.” Stand firm and resist the devil!\r\n\r\nThe Bible says, “And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons” (Mark 16:17). “And when Lord Jesus had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease.” (Matthew 10:1)\r\n\r\nJesus Christ came into this world to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4). God has placed authority in your hands to break the works of Satan. No wicked person can stand against you. No plan of the enemy can rob you of your peace. The victorious Christ stands beside you always!\r\n\r\nAs the Psalmist says, “The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.” (Psalm 46:11)\r\n\r\nChildren of God, those who come against you one way will flee from you in seven ways. The Lord will fill you with power and His promise so no one can stand against you. Use the authority He has given and drive out the enemy!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.” (Revelation 12:11)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
