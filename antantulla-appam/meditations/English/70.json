The second reference is in Genesis 19:26, where Lot’s wife looked back and became a pillar of salt. The third is in Leviticus 2:13, where salt is referred to as sanctified, flavourful, and a sign of blessing, approved by the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe Lord said, “And every offering of your grain offering you shall season with salt; you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.” (Leviticus 2:13)\r\n\r\nIn the presence of God, salt becomes a symbol of holiness. Its whiteness represents purity. Seawater left to dry in the sun crystallizes into pure salt. Likewise, when we are set apart for God, the Sun of Righteousness—Jesus—shines on us and makes us holy.\r\n\r\nThe Romans regarded salt as sacred. For the Jews, it was an essential part of offerings. Will you offer yourselves—your bodies—as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God? (Romans 12:1)\r\n\r\nOne major quality of salt is that it preserves. To keep a dead body from decaying, people use ice and salt. Salt helps preserve things like pickles, keeping bacteria out and preventing spoilage.\r\n\r\nGod calls you to be such a preserving presence in your family and your nation. He said, “I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel” (Ezekiel 3:17). God has a purpose and a plan for your life. And what is that? That you might preserve and protect the people of your nation.\r\n\r\nAnother purpose of salt is purification. For example, when pests infest coconut trees and they fail to bear fruit, people place salt inside the trunk. The salt purifies the tree and destroys the insects. Similarly, if we are to bear fruit for God, we must undergo purification.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Jericho came to Elisha complaining about bad water, he took salt in a new bowl, poured it into the water, and made it pure and wholesome again (2 Kings 2:19–22).\r\n\r\nDear child of God, be useful salt—bringing preservation, purification, and transformation wherever God places you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
