Fools glance superficially and pass on. But the wise observe closely, weigh things carefully, and reflect on them. As a result, they discover deep truths.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus Christ looked at the birds of the air, He said, “Consider them.” Only then can the truth be understood. Birds neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns. Yet they live joyfully without worry. Do you know why? Because the heavenly Father feeds them. The birds place their trust entirely in Him.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, consider the lilies of the field. How do they grow? How do they draw water from the earth? How do they spread their fragrance? Who gives them their beauty? The lilies neither toil nor spin, nor do they worry. Why? Because they know the God, who clothes them.\r\n\r\nBe assured that the Lord who feeds and protects millions of birds and living creatures, will also protect you. Do not waste your days worrying about food, water, or clothing. “For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.” (Matthew 6:31–32)\r\n\r\nA young man once approached a Chinese sage, wanting to gain wisdom. The sage told him, “Go to the forest and listen carefully to the sounds there.” The young man soon returned, saying, “Sir, I heard the sweet music of the birds. The streams spoke to my heart. The gentle breeze sang poetry and touched me softly. I was filled with a deep joy.” The sage was pleased.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when you read the Bible carefully and attentively – not just in a routine manner – you will discover its depths. I have often been amazed when preachers explain the Scriptures in great detail. They share such beautiful revelations and deep mysteries. It is because they meditate deeply on each verse, paying close attention to the interpretations given by the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, do not read the Scriptures hastily or carelessly. Pause, think, and meditate as you read. Only then will you grasp the hidden meaning of God’s Word."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus.” (Hebrews 3:1)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
