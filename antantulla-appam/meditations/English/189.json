(Deuteronomy 26:10)"},"devotion":{"label":"Devotion","text":"Ours is a nation naturally inclined toward piety—a nation that reveres the one it considers to be God. Proverbs like “Do not dwell in a city without a temple” and “It is good to worship in a temple” reflect this spiritual heritage. Yet, many wander aimlessly, searching for the true God, unaware of His presence.\r\n\r\nIn His grace, the divine God has chosen to reveal Himself to us. He came down, cleansed us by His blood, and washed away all our sins. He has given us the unparalleled privilege of being called His children.\r\n\r\nThe Lord, who has done so much for us, desires only one thing in return: that we bow before Him in worship. Only those who worship Him with sincerity can truly be His witnesses, believers, and faithful servants.\r\n\r\nThe Lord our God is the only God. He alone is worthy of worship, praise, thanksgiving, and honour. He alone deserves our wholehearted love. He calls us to love Him with all our heart, soul, and mind.\r\n\r\nThis is why King David proclaimed, “Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand” (Ps. 95:6–7).\r\n\r\nThe words “bow down” and “kneel” signify the humility we should have while worshipping.  Worship should never be with pride or arrogance, but with reverence, love, and humility. This is the adornment that pleases the Lord. The Bible says, “Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (Ps. 96:9).\r\n\r\nA recent study examined churches that experienced rapid growth. The findings revealed that churches prioritizing worship—those worshiping the Lord in spirit and truth—flourished and multiplied.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, churches that worship grow. Families that worship enjoy peace. Prayer groups that worship bring souls to Christ. For the God of worship dwells among those who worship Him.\r\n\r\nLet us bow down, humble ourselves, and worship the Lord with all our hearts."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service”.
