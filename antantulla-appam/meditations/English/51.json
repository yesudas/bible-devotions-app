Examine those passages, meditate on them, and reflect upon them. Through this, you will not only experience the presence of God but also receive countless other blessings.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord chose Joshua to conquer and inherit Canaan, Joshua needed to seek God’s presence. Therefore, the Lord first promised His presence to him, saying, \"As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you.\" (Joshua 1:5)\r\n\r\nThen He said to Joshua, \"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.\" (Joshua 1:8)\r\n\r\nYou may read the Bible, study it, and even memorize it. But the real question is – do you meditate on it? It is during meditation that the power of God strengthens your soul. Without meditation, no one can truly grasp the deep truths hidden in the Word of God.\r\n\r\nDavid was a man of meditation. That is why he wrote, \"Blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night.\" (Psalm 1:2) He not only wrote this but also lived in that blessed experience, saying, \"When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches.\" (Psalm 63:6)\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to meditate? Animals like sheep, cows, camels, and giraffes have a distinctive habit: after grazing, they find a quiet place, sit down, and chew the cud, enjoying the food they have eaten. In the Christian life, meditation is compared to this very process.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, recall the portion of Scripture you have read and ponder it – asking, “What is the lesson here? What is the warning? What is the blessing?” – you taste the depths of the Word and make it part of your life. That is the greatest benefit of meditation."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.\" (Psalm 19:14)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
