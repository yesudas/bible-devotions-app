Where the Lord’s presence is, the servant stands in power.\r\n\r\nHe worked with His disciples through signs and wonders, confirming the Word. Even today, His presence remains unchanged with all who serve Him sincerely.\r\n\r\nWhen the Israelites were taken captive to Babylon, the Lord’s presence went there too. To Daniel, who desired to serve the Lord, God gave abundant presence and favour—along with wisdom that was ten times greater than the wisest in Babylon.\r\n\r\nCan His presence descend into a lion’s den? Yes! When Daniel was thrown into the lion’s den, the Lion of Judah, our Lord, came down, shut the mouths of the lions, and preserved His servant.\r\n\r\nCan His presence come into a fiery furnace? Absolutely! When Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego were cast into the flames, the Son of God walked with them in the fire, and not a hair of their head was singed. Children of God: Never forget that the Lord is with you, in every fiery trial. He is able to protect and preserve you.\r\n\r\nHe has promised this unchanging presence, and He says, “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you.” (Isaiah 43:2)\r\n\r\nWhat a blessed thing—to walk with God, and for God to walk with us! What a glorious privilege to serve the Lord! His unchanging presence will be with us—whether among thorns, in a prison, or standing alone on Mount Carmel, the Lord will always be with us.\r\n\r\nDid He not promise: “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20)? His unchanging presence and sweet fellowship will never depart from you. Dear children of God, in all your ways, acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.” (Genesis 28:15)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
