Whereas the New Testament is a covenant of grace. In the present New Testament era, we depend on the grace of God that is granted through the blood of Christ. And sin shall never have dominion over the children of God, who are under grace.\r\n\r\nThe law of the Old Testament, had enslaved the Israelites; and there was no way they could claim victory over sin. Every year, they kept on sacrificing lambs, as sin offerings; and they could not obtain holiness or complete victory over their sins. They could only cover their sins, through their sin offerings, but could not obtain the grace to conquer over sins.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, Lord Jesus was offered up as a sacrifice, for our sins, once and for all. By placing our faith in that sacrifice, we receive forgiveness of our sins. We also receive the power of the Holy Spirit to conquer over sins and be triumphant in our lives. It is only because of this, that we are able to stand without stumbling and falling, but strengthened to lead victorious lives. The Scripture says, “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death” (Romans 8:2).\r\n\r\nThe power of the Holy Spirit is absolutely necessary, in order to be lead a holy life. It cleanses and makes you holy in heart. Since you are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who resides within you, it is possible for you to overcome sin, and be triumphant always.\r\n\r\nThe children of Israel, in the Old Testament times, were as slaves in Egypt and under the law. But in the New Testament, we are under the covenant of grace. The Son has set us free. “Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” (2 Corinthians 3:17).\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, “For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh” (Romans 8:3).\r\n\r\nWhile under the covenant of grace, you will not have the experience of falling and stumbling again and again in sin. But it promises a holy life that cannot be touched by sin. Children of God, since you have submitted yourselves to the grace of Lord Jesus, sin shall not have dominion over you. “Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God” (1 John 3:9)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me” (Galatians 2:20)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
