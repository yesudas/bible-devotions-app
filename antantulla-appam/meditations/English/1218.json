He has bestowed you with worldly blessings, with spiritual blessings, blessings of heaven and with eternal blessings. After receiving so many blessings, can we afford to remain without praising and thanking Him?\r\n\r\nLook how wonderfully He has created this world, to be of use to you, even for the limited years of life on earth. He has given the sun to shine brightly and give us light, the moon that glows gently in the night, countless stars, potable water to drink, abundant rain, pure air to breathe, huge variety of fruits and food items – how wonderful are the gracious gifts of God! Will you praise and thank Him, with a grateful heart, for all these indescribable gifts?\r\n\r\nYou are so indebted to thank and praise God for the peace that He has granted, for the heavenly joy, for the eternal life, and for the divine restfulness in our lives. Thank Him for listening to your prayers, for granting all your requests, for wiping away all your tears and for turning your sorrows into joy. Thank Him for the wonderful gifts, which are beyond description.\r\n\r\nThe Lord granted the Holy Spirit to dwell within us, and filled us with the power from on high and with heavenly might. He has bestowed you with the gifts of the Spirit and uses you mightily in His hands. He has granted the sweet fruits of the Spirit in you. How can you remain without praising and thanking Him for all these indescribable gifts?! Keep on praising and thanking Him.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, Praise the loving Lord and rejoice in Him, who has forgiven all your iniquities, healed all your diseases, redeemed your life from destruction, crowned you with lovingkindness and tender mercies and renewed your youth like that of the eagle."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over” (Psalm 23:5)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
