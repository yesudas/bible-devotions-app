(Proverbs 31:10)"},"devotion":{"label":"Devotion","text":"Generally in all the weddings, they talk about the virtuous woman; and they will offer advice from Proverbs 31, that a wife should be virtuous.\r\n\r\nBut it is very rare to find a good woman. Solomon, who had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, said, “One man among a thousand I have found, But a woman among all these I have not found.\" (Ecclesiastes 7:28).\r\n\r\nA virtuous woman is the one who builds the house and oversees her home.  She wakes up in the dark and feeds her household.  She does not have the attitude of letting the maid take care of the household.  She cares about the people in the house and about their safety.  She gets the warm clothing ready for the winter.  It is her duty to bring everyone in the family into the fortress of the Blood of Jesus.\r\n\r\nShe does not have a low regard for household chores, but does each of them with due care and attention.  In many families, if you ask the wife about the whereabouts of her husband, she may not know.  Or if you were to ask them about the children, they will be irresponsible and say, he should have gone to some friend’s place.  If the wife were to be so irresponsible, what will be the state of that family?  A virtuous woman guides the family in the right path.\r\n\r\nA virtuous woman opens her mouth to impart wisdom. Gracious teaching is on her tongue. She does not indulge in slander or gossip.  She does not keep her blessings to herself, but extends her arms of love, to the poor and needy.  She gives her full cooperation and shares in the responsibility of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe wise man Solomon said that he found one man among a thousand.  He is Lord Jesus Christ.  He is fairer and chief among thousands and ten thousands.  And the virtuous woman, is the bride of Christ – the Church.  “For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones…. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. (Ephesians 5:30,32)\r\n\r\nEven if you do not have all the qualities of a virtuous woman, you should strive hard to acquire some of those good qualities.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, a caterpillar goes through many stages in its early life, before finally transforming into a beautiful butterfly, which flies so gracefully.  In the same manner, we should also be transformed and fly toward Lord Jesus – the lover of our soul, to meet him in the air."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
