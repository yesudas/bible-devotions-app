We must pray with power. We must pray with faith, expecting an answer, believing that the Lord hears our prayers. And, through the above verse, the apostle Paul gives us another strong counsel—to be steadfast in prayer. Yes, our prayers must be marked by perseverance.\r\n\r\nOur beloved Lord not only listens to our prayers but also answers them. Yet, not every prayer receives an answer. Some prayers are lifeless, mechanical, routine, or just done out of obligation or tradition. Such prayers are not heard.\r\n\r\nBut prayers that are fervent, sincere, and that arise from a humble and broken heart are never ignored by the Lord. Think of the prayer of Jacob, the patriarch. He wrestled with God through the night, clinging on and pleading, “I will not let You go unless You bless me.” (Genesis 32:26)\r\n\r\nIn that moment of fear and distress—especially concerning his elder brother—Jacob knew of no other help but to cling steadfastly to the Lord. And in response to that unwavering prayer, the Lord blessed Jacob, gave him a new name—Israel, and brought peace between him and his brother.\r\n\r\nConsider the prayer of Elijah. What earnestness he showed! About his prayer, the Scripture says: “Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.” (James 5:17–18)\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for the growth of the early Church was the fervent prayer of the believers. We read in the Bible that “these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication” (Acts 1:14).\r\n\r\nDear children of God, your prayer should never be a mere formality. Let it be in spirit and truth—intentional, powerful, and persevering. Then, surely, the Lord will answer. “For surely there is a hereafter, and your hope will not be cut off.” (Proverbs 23:18)"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?” (Luke 18:7)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
