You are called to experience joy not only on earth but also in heaven. The Lord desires joy to dwell in your home and in His church.\r\n\r\nIn earthly life, a joyful family is a great blessing. When husband, wife, and children are always joyful together, there is no greater beauty than such a home. Face problems together as a family. Pray together. Share joy together.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some husbands leave their wives and children at home and enjoy themselves with friends, eating out alone and spending leisure time selfishly. Peace is unlikely to flourish in such homes.\r\n\r\nInstead of chasing after fleeting worldly pleasures rooted in sin, if you begin to experience the spiritual joy that the Lord gives, it will be lasting and eternal. The pleasures of this world end in sorrow. But the joy of the Lord is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10).\r\n\r\nJesus Himself promised this divine joy: “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full” (John 15:11).\r\n\r\nWhen does true joy enter a child of God’s life? It begins the moment sins are forgiven. A great joy of salvation fills the heart. The joy of knowing: “The Lord has accepted me as His child. My name is written in the Book of Life. I am a child of the King of kings and Lord of lords.”\r\n\r\n*The Word says, “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness” (Isaiah 61:10).\r\n\r\nThis is not just joy, but overflowing with joy!*\r\n\r\nEven Mary, the mother of Jesus, rejoiced and said, “My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior” (Luke 1:47). Lord Jesus Himself also experienced such divine joy: “Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit” (Luke 10:21).\r\n\r\nBeloved child of God, the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit is unmatched. It is joy straight from heaven."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “You rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of your souls.” (1 Peter 1:8–9)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
