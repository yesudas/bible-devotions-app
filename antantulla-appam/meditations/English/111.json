Satan seeks to imprison, but God grants us dominion. Satan brings curses, but Christ brings life and blessing.\r\n\r\nNo one is born with authority. But as a child grows, parents entrust them with authority. In the same way, as we grow spiritually, God grants us spiritual authority—a divine empowerment from above.\r\n\r\nEven the most powerful person on earth does not have authority over death, the grave, or eternity. But our Heavenly Father, in His mercy, gives such authority and power only to His own children.\r\n\r\nConsider a traffic police officer. He may be just an ordinary man. But because of the authority and power granted to him by the government, he has the right to control traffic. When he raises his hand, even heavy trucks come to a halt. When he signals \"go,\" the vehicles move forward.\r\n\r\nHe may not be physically strong to stop a vehicle by his own strength. Yet when he raises his hand to stop the vehicles, even the largest trucks obey his command.\r\n\r\nNow consider the authority God has given you. Among all the privileges we’ve received, the greatest is this: “To all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.” (John 1:12). What a glorious authority—to be called a child of God!\r\n\r\nDear children of God, the Christian life is not one of fear, defeat, or bondage. It is a life of victory and boldness in Christ. Walk in the authority He has given you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And he who overcomes, and keeps My works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations— as I also have received from My Father.” (Revelation 2:26)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
