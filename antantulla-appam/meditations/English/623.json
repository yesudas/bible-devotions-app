There two armies were standing against each other; on the one side there was the army of Israel; and on the other side the army of Philistines.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, a giant named Goliath rose up from the army of Philistines. He challenged the army of Israel and asked, “who among you can fight with me?”; and He cursed the God of Israel. Forty days passed with the same routine.\r\n\r\nAll through those forty days, none of the Israelites had the courage to stand up against Goliath and fight with him. And finally, David came to that Valley of Elah; and he prevailed over Goliath with a sling and a stone.\r\n\r\nWe can read of many battles in the Scripture. Some of those battle fields are visible to our eyes; but some others can not be seen with our eyes of flesh. Adam did not understand that the Garden of Eden was a battle field; and he failed to protect the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were very indifferent and unconcerned about safeguarding the garden. As a result, satan entered into the garden and deceived Eve; sin, curse, sickness and death entered into the world. Man had to lose the presence of God, and proximity with God and left stranded as a destitute.\r\n\r\nThe veins in our body is also a battle field that we can not see. Viruses somehow enter into the blood vessels, fight against the white blood cells in the body. If the viruses prevail, then we get various diseases. But if the white blood cells win in the battle, then we will have good health.\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Genesis, we read about the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea) as the first battle field. “And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar… made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah…. All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea)” (Genesis 14:1-3).\r\n\r\nToday, you are in a battle field; and there is an adversary who is standing against you – he is none other than satan (called as Lucifer). The spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places are standing with satan (Ephesians 6:12). You have to necessarily fight against the world; the flesh; and the adversary.\r\n\r\nBut the triumphant Jesus, the Lord of victory is standing with you in all majesty. Angels, cherubim and seraphim numbering ten thousand times ten thousand are standing on your side; to help you, to encourage you and to strengthen you. “The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace” (Exodus 14:14)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle” (Psalm 144:1)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
