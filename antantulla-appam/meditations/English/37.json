We have received this priceless treasure in our earthly vessels – our bodies. While the Lord advises us to stir up the Spirit, He also warns us not to quench the Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit is like a fire that burns within us. When we pray and praise, that fire blazes brightly, and the gifts of the Spirit operate powerfully. But when we grieve the Spirit, that fire is quenched.\r\n\r\nThink of a kerosene lamp. If the lamp runs out of oil, or if there is no proper contact between the oil and the wick, or if it is placed where it is rainy or windy, the flame will go out. In the same way, if we ignore the promptings and guidance of the Holy Spirit, neglect prayer, and fall into deliberate sin, we ourselves will be quenching the Spirit.\r\n\r\nMany believers and servants of God who were once powerfully used by the Spirit later lost their light and influence because they fell into sin – especially immorality, adultery, and lust. If you want to keep the Spirit’s fire burning, never give room to sinful desires. Keep your body – the temple of the Holy Spirit – holy and under careful discipline.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture warns: “For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness. Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit.” (1 Thessalonians 4:7–8)\r\n\r\nIn the life of David – who loved the Lord deeply – lust crept in quietly. As he walked on the roof of his palace, his eyes were drawn by desire, and eventually he fell into grievous sin. Only when he began to taste the bitter consequences of that act did he realise the depth of the damage. That is why he cried out in tears:“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me by Your generous Spirit.” (Psalm 51:10–12)\r\n\r\nDear children of God, never allow the fire of the Spirit to be quenched. Keep it burning and blazing within you at all times. Your true greatness lies in the fact that the Holy Spirit dwells in you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.” (Romans 12:11)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
