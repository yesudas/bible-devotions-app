In His love, He unveils hidden things to His children, revealing treasures that lie in darkness. To reveal means to remove the veil. Once the veil is lifted, what was once concealed becomes visible.\r\n\r\nConsider a statue that remains covered until its unveiling. When the appointed time comes, the veil is removed, and the statue is revealed to all. In the same way, God has chosen to reveal mysteries that have been hidden since the beginning to His servants in these last days.\r\n\r\nWhen John was exiled on the island of Patmos, the Lord revealed to him extraordinary visions—revelations about Jesus, the church, heaven, satan, hell, and eternity.\r\n\r\nThe Lord will also give you revelations. He will grant you wisdom and knowledge. He promises, “I will break through the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron; I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches” (Isaiah 45:3).\r\n\r\nLook at the life of Daniel – and the great many hidden things that God revealed to him! King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream was a mystery even to the one who dreamed it. But when Daniel prayed, the Lord not only revealed the dream but also its meaning.\r\n\r\nThat is why Daniel praised God, saying: \"He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding. He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with Him” (Daniel 2:21-22).\r\n\r\nThe Lord, who spoke in times past through the prophets, now speaks to us through His Son: \"God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son” (Hebrews 1:1-2).\r\n\r\nJust as He revealed His plans to Abraham, saying, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?” (Genesis 18:17), He will surely grant you revelations—insights into your family, ministry, and church.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, seek Him with all your heart, and He will reveal His mysteries to you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you” (John 15:15)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
