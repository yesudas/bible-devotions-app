Even our Lord had to go through distress; perplexion and sorrow. At the Garden of Gethsemane He said to His disciples, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me” (Matthew 26:38).\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord Himself was distressed with sorrow, will we, as His children be spared from it? We will have sorrows; troubles and tribulations. The Lord foreknew this and said, “In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).\r\n\r\nWhat was the reason for the Lord’s distress? Was it because of His fear of shame and reproach? Was it the fear of death? Was it the distress of having to bear the whiplashes and the crown of thorns? No. But it was because He had to offer Himself at the hands of sinners; that He who knew no sin had to become sin; and that Father God will turn His face away from Him for a moment as He bears the sins of the whole world.\r\n\r\nPrayer is the only remedy for distress and fear. The time of prayer is the time when the Lord comforts us; and that is the time when we overcome our fears and anxieties and be strengthened in the Lord.\r\n\r\nSee, how the Lord poured out His heart in prayer at the Garden of Gethsemane! He poured out His heart and soul. He fell on His face and He was exceeding sorrowful , even to death.\r\n\r\nAfter He had prayed, He was greatly strengthened. And He said, “Rise, let us be going” (Matthew 26:46). He had the boldness to face the Cross; to receive whiplashes; to be nailed to Cross; to face death, the hades and satan.\r\n\r\nWhenever you are troubled, kneel down in the presence of God, and pour out your heart. Openly share all your struggles; challenges and issues with the Lord.\r\n\r\nCast all your burdens on the Lord, and wait in faith, for He cares for you. “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7).\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, “You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You” (Isaiah 26:3).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, do not run after men, when you are troubled; as it will not have any beneficial impact. Surrender yourself completely at the feet of the Lord. He shall console you like a mother. And He shall grant you comfort and peace."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose” (Romans 8:28)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
