Yet, not every prayer receives an answer. Why is that? Is God partial? Certainly not! Then what is the reason behind unanswered prayers?\r\n\r\n“If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear.” (Psalm 66:18)\r\n\r\nSinful thoughts, wicked intentions, and malicious attitudes act as spiritual blockages to our prayers.\r\n\r\nThat is why, before we pray, we must examine our relationship with God. Is there harmony and unity between us and Him? The Bible says, “Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him.” (John 9:31). “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)\r\n\r\nDear children of God, confess your sins and set your heart right before Him.\r\n\r\n“And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.” (Mark 11:25)\r\n\r\nWhen we recite the Lord’s Prayer, do we realize what we are asking? “Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.” If we are unwilling to forgive others, then we cannot expect to receive forgiveness from the Lord—or answers to our prayers.\r\n\r\n“And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men.” (Matthew 6:5)\r\n\r\nTo explain this, Lord Jesus gave a parable. A Pharisee and a tax collector went to the temple to pray. The Pharisee exalted himself and recited his self-righteousness before God. But that prayer brought him no benefit.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, always pray from the depths of your heart—with humility, sincerity, and a spirit of repentance."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss.” (James 4:3)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
