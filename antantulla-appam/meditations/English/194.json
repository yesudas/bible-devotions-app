(Philippians 4:6)"},"devotion":{"label":"Devotion","text":"Let your requests be made known to heaven.  Let your requests be made known to your heavenly Father; He is the One who created you, He is the One who guides you, and He is the One who accomplishes and perfects everything for you.  What benefit is there in telling others about your problems when you can tell Him? Go to God first.\r\n\r\nA pastor, hurrying for his Sunday service, was approached by a young woman who began to describe her many troubles. The pastor listened patiently and then said gently, “Daughter, I understand your pain. But did you first take this to the Lord? How much time did you spend speaking to Him this morning? He is the One who was crowned with thorns for you, and He is the One who shed His precious blood and gave His life for you.  It is pointless to speak to me without speaking to Him”.  After saying this, he went on his way for the Sunday Morning Service.\r\n\r\nConsider the woman in the Bible who suffered for twelve years, seeking healing from many doctors and spending all she had, yet found no relief. Finally, she turned to Jesus, touched the hem of His garment, and was healed instantly. How different her life could have been if she had sought Jesus first! Twelve years of pain and loss could have been avoided.\r\n\r\nSadly, many follow the same pattern today. They wander in every direction, seeking solutions from the world, only to find themselves disappointed before turning to the Lord. “I paid thousands to brokers in the hope of getting a job abroad, but they cheated me. Pray for me,” they say. Others lament, “I tried everything to arrange my daughter’s marriage, but nothing worked. Now I’ve come to the Lord.”\r\n\r\nThis is why Jesus taught us, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you” (Matt. 6:33).\r\n\r\nBring your needs and struggles to the Lord, who is able to satisfy every need. Nothing is impossible for Him. He declares, “Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?” (Jer. 32:27).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, He will hear your prayers and make a way where there is none. He can part the Red Sea, bring water from the rock, halt the sun and moon, and tear down the walls of Jericho. Trust in Him, for He alone is able to do the impossible."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Ah, Lord God!
