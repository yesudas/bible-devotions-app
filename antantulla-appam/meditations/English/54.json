Therefore, those who long to experience the presence of God must learn to cultivate a life of praise.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says, “What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to Him? And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?” (Deuteronomy 4:7–8)\r\n\r\nDavid, who deeply desired to dwell always in God's presence, made a firm decision: “I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.” (Psalm 34:1)\r\n\r\nA philosopher once said, “Those who recognize and appreciate the goodness in others are the ones who are most joyful and healthy.” But how much more joyful, strong, and victorious are those who constantly remember the goodness of God and praise Him for His greatness!\r\n\r\nKing David declares: “It is good to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High; to declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night, on an instrument of ten strings, on the lute, and on the harp, with harmonious sound.” (Psalm 92:1–3) Yes, praising the Lord is good—not just for our spirit, soul, and body, but for our entire life.\r\n\r\nA friend once had his watch set to ring every hour. Whenever the alarm sounded, he would close his eyes for a couple of minutes and simply praise the Lord. He testified that doing this made him increasingly aware of God's presence surrounding him throughout the day.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a bus driver who was born again once said, “When I’m driving and when the traffic light turns red, I don’t get irritated like others. For me, it becomes a moment of praise and a time to sense the presence of God.”\r\n\r\nDear child of God, would you consider establishing a pattern of praise in your life? If you make praising God a daily habit, you will find it uplifting and deeply joyful."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Praise the Lord, call upon His name; declare His deeds among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted.” (Isaiah 12:4)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
