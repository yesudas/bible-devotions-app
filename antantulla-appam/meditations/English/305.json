Solomon means 'peace'. Solomon was born, as promised to David.  The name of his mother is Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nDavid had to fight all his life to protect Israelites, the people of God.  The Israelites were surrounded by many enemies.  Philistines, Amalekites, and Midianites kept on invading Israel.  And David had to continuously engage in wars, in order to protect God’s people.\r\n\r\nDavid also had to expand the boundaries of Israel, as God had spoken to Abraham.  Because there was so much bloodshed during the reign of David, he could not build the temple of God.  So the Lord commanded Solomon, as the son of peace.  And the Lord removed his enemies all around and made him to reign in peace.\r\n\r\nPeace is very important in the Christian life. Christ has fought the battle of Calvary for us and has triumphantly declared, 'It is finished', and has put Satan under our feet.\r\n\r\nWe must inherit and claim His victory on the cross. Then God's peace that surpasses all understanding will reign in our hearts.\r\n\r\nLord Jesus said, \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\" (John 14:27)\r\n\r\nChildren of God, you should necessarily have three kinds of peace.  Firstly, peace within yourself. When you accept Jesus Christ, as your Lord and Master, He comes into your life as the Prince of Peace, and resides within you.  Then you will be completely liberated from your guilty conscience and you will be filled with the divine light of peace comes into you.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you must be at peace with all men. The Scripture says, \"Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord:\" (Hebrews 12:14)\r\n\r\nThirdly, you need to have peace with God. You will receive the peace of God, when you turn away from all your sinful ways, and live a holy life.  The Lord will also rejoice and be glad in you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\" (Philippians 4:7)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
