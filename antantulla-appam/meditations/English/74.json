Only then will you fully experience the union and joy that comes from the Lord.\r\n\r\nDuring a wedding, both families carefully observe whether the bride and groom are truly joyful. If even there is a trace of unhappiness in their faces, the loved ones strive to remove the cause and restore joy.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if husbands and wives live in harmony, bringing joy to one another and avoiding misunderstandings, their home will be beautifully built up. And the Lord will surely rejoice over them.\r\n\r\nBut in many worldly marriages, joy fades quickly. Bitterness and strife soon enter and crush the happiness of the new life together. As a proverb says, ‘Even milk gets sour over time, and much honey gets too sweet to taste’. But the joy of the Lord over us is like a ceaseless spring—unchanging, unquenchable, and overflowing daily.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways people often approach God in prayer:\r\n\r\nAnd the better approach is way too clear.\r\n\r\nSome prayers are full of grumbling: “Why, Lord, only me? Why must I suffer like Job? Others are doing fine. Only I see no dawn. When will You have mercy on me?” Such people approach God with complaints and disappointment.\r\n\r\nBut look at Jesus—how joyfully He spoke with the Father even in sorrow. When Lazarus died, Jesus was deeply moved and wept along with others. Yet, He looked to the Father with joy, saying, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me” (John 11:41). And instantly, the Father heard His prayer and raised Lazarus to life.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, rejoice in the Lord. He will surely answer your prayers."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.” (John 15:11)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
