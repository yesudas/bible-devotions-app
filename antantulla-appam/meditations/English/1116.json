He is mighty to give you the grace to overcome and be victorious over the world, the flesh and Satan, just as He overcame. Your calling is to take hold of victory upon victory. It’s a right of every believer to move from strength to strength. And grace upon grace is the promise given to you by the Lord.\r\n\r\nSatan may sow many thoughts of failures in your heart. He may discourage you by bringing in lust of the flesh and many worldly struggles to mind. In all those moments, you should lean on the Victorious Lord and His word. His words will make you holy.\r\n\r\nFirmly implant the word of the Lord in your heart and mind, in your thought and memory. To the extent that you meditate on the word of God, the power of the word will kindle your spirit, soul and body. Prophet Jeremiah says: “But His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones” (Jeremiah 20:9). King David says: “My heart was hot within me; While I was musing, the fire burned” (Psalm 39:3).\r\n\r\nIf the words of your mouth and the meditations of your heart should be holy, your heart should be filled with verses of the Holy Bible. The Scripture also tells us: “for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks”.\r\n\r\n“Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” (Psalm 119:11). This verse tells us how David learned the secret of an overcoming life. The words that fill our heart, will help in the holiness of our speech and the way we conduct our life. That is why Apostle Peter writes: “that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God” (1 Peter 4:2).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, if your heart is brimming with the word of God, then even your dreams will be holy and pure. If you examine yourself and cleanse your heart before going to sleep, it will pave way for you to see the visions of God. Give importance to the word of God and study it. Meditate on His word and walk in it’s light. Then you will move from holiness to holiness and live an overcoming life."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Psalm 119:105)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
