There are ten thousand times ten thousand angels, cherubim and seraphim, who are singing, praising and worshipping God all day and night.\r\n\r\nWhen Apostle Paul was imprisoned, he was longing in his heart to have communion with the Lord. It was then he beheld a door standing open in heaven. The heavenly Father also called him and said, “Come up here”. What a blessed calling that should have been!\r\n\r\nLet your ears always be open to listen to the voice of God. Enoch listened to the voice of God, and walked with God (Genesis 5:24). Noah listened to the voice of God and built an ark to preserve himself from destruction (Genesis 6:9). Moses spoke face to face with the Lord (Exodus 33:11).\r\n\r\nEven today, the Lord is calling you to come up. Therefore, do not be stagnant in your current position. You should continually make a progress in your spiritual and prayer life. You should have an experience of progressing and ascending every day of your life. The Lord is calling you to make a steady progress in the love of God, and in your anointing.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of ‘ascending’ or ‘being taken up’ in the Scripture. Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind to heaven in a chariot of fire, with horses of fire. The Lord used the cloud to go up to heaven. “He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight” (Acts 1:9). He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God (Mark 16:19, Hebrews 1:3).\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, “Lift up your heads, O you gates! and be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in” (Psalm 24:7).\r\n\r\nThe Lord who called John to ‘come up’, sent the Holy Spirit and caused him to be in the Spirit (Revelation 4:1-2). He took him through the gate of heaven and into the eternal kingdom. Lord Jesus has gone ahead of us into heaven, and has kept the door open for us.\r\n\r\nWhat is the door of heaven? Lord Jesus says, “I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture” (John 10:9).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, when you go through Jesus, you can easily reach heaven. Jesus says, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven” (Revelation 19:1)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
