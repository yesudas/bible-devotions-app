Through prayer, we can impart divine comfort, peace, joy, and contentment to many lives.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be impossible to meet and help each person directly due to limitations of time and circumstances, prayer transcends those barriers. When we fervently intercede for those in need, the Lord works across time, distance, and seasons, performing miracles in their lives.\r\n\r\n“Am I a God near at hand,” says the Lord, “And not a God afar off? (Jeremiah 23:23). Kneel and pray for missionaries labouring in distant lands—for their safety and that God may use them mightily. Intercede for ministers working in challenging regions, such as the dark continents of Africa. Lift up believers who stand as bold witnesses even amidst persecution in oppressive regimes, including communist nations.\r\n\r\nYour prayers have the power to encourage them, strengthen their faith, and invite divine intervention in their lives. Through your heartfelt intercession, the hand of God moves, altering the course of nations and bringing blessings to countless people.\r\n\r\nThe Bible speaks of Lord Jesus Christ, and says, “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him” (Acts 10:38).\r\n\r\nConsider Job, a man of piety and prayer. Each morning, he rose early to intercede for his children, offering sacrifices and sanctifying them. Scripture records, “So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly” (Job 1:5).\r\n\r\nPrayer is a unique opportunity to do immense good for others, far beyond what we can accomplish through physical actions alone. It brings blessings that ripple through countless lives. Children of God, through personal prayer, you have the privilege of being a channel of divine blessings to thousands."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “If you do well, will you not be accepted?
