It is rare, rich, and glorifying. God, through us, spreads this fragrance in every place. Apostle Paul, rejoicing in this truth, glorifies God by saying, “Thanks be to God who&#8230; makes manifest the fragrance of His knowledge through us in every place.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord met Saul (later Paul) on the road to Damascus, the first thing that stirred in his heart was this deep question: “Lord, who are You?” (Acts 9:5). To truly know who Christ is would take an entire lifetime—and even that would not be enough. Yet, Paul was so eager to know Him that the Lord revealed Himself by saying, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.”\r\n\r\nGod is loving, compassionate, light, the way, the door, the truth, and the life. At the same time, He revealed that He is the One who suffers when His people suffer. What a profound revelation!\r\n\r\nBut Paul didn’t stop with just one revelation. He longed to know Christ more deeply. That is why he says, “I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord… that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings…” (Philippians 3:8,10)\r\n\r\nDear child of God, the more you desire to know Christ, the more you will become a pleasing fragrance to Him. Apostle Peter writes, “His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us…” (2 Peter 1:3)\r\n\r\nThe blessings that come through the knowledge of Christ are immeasurable. Through it, we receive all we need for life and godliness. We partake in His divine power and receive eternal life.\r\n\r\nScripture warns that if we do not grow in this knowledge, we will become unfruitful and ineffective:\r\n\r\n“For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2 Peter 1:8)\r\n\r\nIt also warns against turning back after knowing Him: “For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning.” (2 Peter 2:20)\r\n\r\nDear child of God, will you seek to know the Lord more intimately? Let it be your heart cry to want to know Him more, and to draw closer to Him. And let your life be filled with the fragrance of divine knowledge."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\" (2 Peter 3:18)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
