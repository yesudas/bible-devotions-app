Zechariah was a priest in the lineage of Aaron.\r\n\r\nIn those days, the priests were divided into twenty four groups. And each group would have the privilege of serving in the presence of God for two weeks in a year.\r\n\r\nTheir ministry will only be for two weeks in a year. They would draw lots in order to decide as to who would enter the Most Holy Place, and only that person can enter. And on that occasion, the lot fell on the aged Zechariah.\r\n\r\nZechariah had a deep wound in his heart: that the Lord had not granted him a child. We read in Luke 1:6, that Zechariah and his wife were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEven though they were so faithful to the Lord, they were hurt that the Lord did not bless them with a child, and kept his wife as a barren woman.\r\n\r\nOn that day, the angel appeared before Zechariah, who was deeply wounded in his heart, and said, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.’” (Luke 1:13-15). When the angel spoke these words, Zechariah could not believe them. Because of the scar of his deep wound, he could not grasp the promise immediately and praise God for that. For many years he had prayed without getting an answer, and now when he did, it was beyond his belief.\r\n\r\nThe disciples of Jesus were eagerly expecting that Jesus will reign over Israel as their king, and they will also reign with him.\r\n\r\nBut they were deeply wounded in their hearts, when Lord Jesus submitted Himself to be crucified on the Cross. It was as if all their hopes were in vain. But Jesus who died, rose again from death, and appeared unto them.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, today the Lord desires to heal all your wounds; and do a new thing in your life. All your deep wounds will be healed."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For I will restore health to you and heal you of your wounds,’ says the Lord” (Jeremiah 30:17)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
