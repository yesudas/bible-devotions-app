May you taste the grace of the Lord every day in the new year! May you be strengthened and established in His grace every day of this new year!\r\n\r\nEvery morning, you should kneel down in the presence of God and pray for His grace to be poured upon you. You should also praise and thank the Lord for all the graces that He has showered upon you since your early days.\r\n\r\nForefather Abraham had the habit of rising early (Genesis 21:1, 22:3). When the Lord asked him to sacrifice his son Isaac, it crushed the heart of Abraham. Nevertheless, he rose up early in the morning to fulfill the word of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says: “ So, Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him” (Genesis 22:3).\r\n\r\nGod in His abundant grace, made Manna to rain down for them. They neither sowed; nor watered and not reaped. But the Lord in His bounteous grace, rained down Manna for the two million Israelites every morning, for forty long years.\r\n\r\nBut Moses never forgot of the grace of early morning. He prayed: “Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!” (Psalm 90:14). It is to grant that new grace that the Lord called him to come up to Mount Sinai in the morning. “So be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain” (Exodus 34:2).\r\n\r\nIn order for you to multiply in grace, it is very essential that you sit at the feet of the Lord in the early hours to taste and experience His grace. Your life will be filled with divine power, strength and might when you study the word of the Lord; and meditate on His love and grace.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, the Lord God who walked in the garden of Eden in the cool of the day, will grant you new graces every morning in this new year and make you taste his infinite love. He will bless you abundantly."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “O God, You are my God; early will I seek You; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water” (Psalm 63:1-3)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
