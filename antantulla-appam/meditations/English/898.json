It is to give you victory, that He has descended from heaven and is residing within you. He will not keep quiet, when any enemy rises up against you, or when any sorcerer schemes evil against you. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will break all the powers of the enemy and grant you victory.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no strength in you; when you are exhausted, the Spirit of the Lord prays to strengthen you for the battle. He also stands by your side as a Mighty warrior to fight your battles. Apostle Paul asks boldly: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? “ (Romans 8:35).\r\n\r\nLord Jesus Himself introduced the Holy Spirit, the Helper (John 14:26). He is a Helper and a Comforter, who comforts and encourages, like a mother. And on the other hand, He fills you with the strength from above, so that you can stand strong and win your battles. The fact that the Holy Spirt – part of the Divine Trinity, is residing within you, should not be taken lightly. It is a great and wonderful privilege and experience. He conquers all your enemies and grants you victory upon victory.\r\n\r\nThere was a Believer, who had to tread through a forest area, during one of his travels. As he walked along, suddenly, a venomous snake was about to attack him. There was a great fear in him, as such attack could result in death. But the Holy Spirit filled him, and asked him to gently command in tongues, to the serpent not to blast, to be quiet and to go back. When he did that, the snake quietly went back on its way. When we have the Holy Spirit – the Comforter and Helper, we need not fear anything.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit will lift up a standard; will lift up the flag of victory for you. While instructing the seven churches, He finally says: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God”  (Revelation 2:7).\r\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit is the main reason for your victorious and overcoming life. In the Scripture, we read about Samson, as follows:  “And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand” (Judges 14:6). Children of God, hold firmly and rely completely on the Holy Spirit. He is the spirit of liberty. “The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” (2 Corinthians 3:17)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind” (2 Timothy 1:7)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
