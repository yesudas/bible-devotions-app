In the Old Testament, He chose the twelve sons of Jacob and made them the tribes of Israel. In the New Testament, He chose twelve disciples and made them apostles.\r\n\r\nIn those days, through the Israelites, the Lord glorified His name and gave them the inheritance of the land of Canaan. In the New Testament, He chose the apostles; proclaimed the Gospel through them and led people into salvation.\r\n\r\nFellowship with such children of God brings into our lives the presence of God, divine joy, and peace.\r\n\r\nYet in many churches, there is no unity or loving fellowship with one another. People come separately and leave separately. In some places, there is one church for those of “higher” caste and another for those of “lower” caste. This is truly a matter of deep sorrow.\r\n\r\nChrist is never divided, nor does He desire a division in His body – the Church. As we have already seen, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3).\r\n\r\nWhen we have been washed by the same blood, quenched by the same Spirit, and share the same Father, there should be no divisions, quarrels, or differences among us. Every trace of division should be removed, whenever we gather together as a Church, so that we may rejoice in the sweet presence of God.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the dew of Hermon, descending upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the blessing – life forevermore.” (Psalm 133:1–3)\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we must love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength. At the same time, we must love others as we love ourselves.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, if we cannot love our brother whom we see, how can we love the Lord whom we do not see? Whether in the home or in the church, if there is no unity in love, the presence of God cannot be experienced."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way.
