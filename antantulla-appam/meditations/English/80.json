The Catholic Bible version of this verse renders it as: “Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ and manifests through us the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.”\r\n\r\nBeloved, in God’s sight, we are the fragrance of Christ—both among those who are saved and those who are lost.\r\n\r\nIn Apostle Paul’s time, the Roman emperor had many generals under him. During times of war, he would send each of them out in different directions with one clear command: conquer territory for the Roman Empire and bring back at least 5,000 captives.\r\n\r\nWhen a victorious general returned with his soldiers, there would be a grand triumphal procession through the streets of Rome. Trumpets would sound as they entered the city. People would gather in the large square before the royal palace and burn incense in large quantities, letting its sweet fragrance fill the air.\r\n\r\nThis entire city would be filled with the aroma of victory—a welcoming fragrance for the victorious army, but at the same time, a fragrance of death for the captured enemies, marking their defeat and impending judgment.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Jesus Christ came into this world and on the cross of Calvary, He conquered the world, the flesh, and Satan. He cried out in triumph, “It is finished!” (John 19:30)—a declaration of complete victory. The crushing of the enemy’s head was part of that great victory.\r\n\r\nAnd now, we have a share and a right in that victory. To us, it is the fragrance of triumph, but to Satan and the powers of darkness, it is the stench of death and defeat.\r\n\r\nThat’s why Apostle Paul exclaims: “Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.” (2 Corinthians 2:14)\r\n\r\nDear child of God, you are called to victory. In Christ, you are more than a conqueror. Whether you walk or run, may you spread the aroma of Christ’s victory wherever you go. As you advance each day, may you go forward in victory, carrying the fragrance of triumph!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (1 Corinthians 15:57)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
