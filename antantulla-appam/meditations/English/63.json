The wealthy oppress the poor. Officials accept bribes and twist justice. Politicians exploit the helpless—even preying upon the homes of widows. Injustice and violence abound on every side!\r\n\r\nBut what about the protection of God's children? The Lord declares with certainty, “I will plead your cause; I will advocate for you.” No matter how dire your situation may be, turn your eyes toward the Lord and cry out to Him.\r\n\r\nThe Lord surely hears your prayer. David testifies, “But know that the Lord has set apart for Himself him who is godly; the Lord will hear when I call to Him.” (Psalm 4:3). And not only does He hear your prayers—He also pleads your case.\r\n\r\nWhen the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness, they brought their disputes to Moses. Later, they approached judges to settle their matters. And eventually, kings ruled in Israel and judged cases with wisdom and fairness.\r\n\r\nToday, our King of kings and Lord of lords—our precious Savior—is our perfect and righteous Judge. Let us bring our cases before Him!\r\n\r\nWhen King Saul unjustly pursued David and hunted him down, where could David turn for justice? He told Saul, “May the Lord judge between you and me, and may the Lord avenge me on you.” (1 Samuel 24:15). And the Lord did indeed plead David’s cause.\r\n\r\n“Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Genesis 18:25). The Lord stood between Saul and David and gave a just verdict. He took the kingdom from Saul and handed it to David.\r\n\r\nWhether the problem is great or small, David’s habit was always to take his concerns to the Lord. He prayed, “Plead my cause, O Lord, with those who strive with me; fight against those who fight against me.” (Psalm 35:1).\r\n\r\nDear child of God, whatever your case may be, take it first to the Lord. Go to His sanctuary and lay your concerns at His feet. He will take it up. He will plead your cause. He will act justly."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Plead my cause and redeem me; revive me according to Your word.” (Psalm 119:154)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
