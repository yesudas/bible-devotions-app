In Him, “All the promises of God are Yes, and in Him Amen” (2 Corinthians 1:20).\r\n\r\nTherefore, as we pray, let us cling to His promises. “For He who promised is faithful” (Hebrews 10:23). Not only is He faithful, but He is also “able to do what He has promised” (Romans 4:21).\r\n\r\nTake time to write down the promises of healing found in the Bible. Memorize them, meditate on them, and claim them in faith as you pray. Speak these promises aloud as confessions of faith:\r\n\r\n“I will bring none of the diseases I brought upon the Egyptians” (Exodus 15:26).\r\n\r\n“By His stripes we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).\r\n\r\n“He Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases” (Matthew 8:17).\r\n\r\n“He sent out His word and healed them, and delivered them from destruction” (Psalm 107:20).\r\n\r\n“He forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases… He satisfies you” (Psalm 103:3, 5).\r\n\r\n“The Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in its wings for you who fear My name” (Malachi 4:2).\r\n\r\nIncorporate these promises into your prayers, allowing them to renew your spirit and strengthen your faith. The Word of God is alive and powerful—it has the power to bring life to dry bones.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, take note of the steps that you need to take in order to receive divine healing. If sickness has come as a result of sin, look to the cross of Calvary and accept the forgiveness offered through the precious blood of Jesus. If illness has stemmed from bitterness or an unforgiving heart, release those burdens and extend forgiveness. This act of surrender and repentance opens the door for miraculous healing.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, embrace His promises with unwavering faith. The Lord’s healing power is available to you, for He is the same yesterday, today, and forever."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The Lord will strengthen him on his bed of illness; You will sustain him on his sickbed” (Psalm 41:3)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
