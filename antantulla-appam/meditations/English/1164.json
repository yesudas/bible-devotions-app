Trouble is basically a test of Satan. Some people, when they are troubled, are not aware of the impact of their actions and commit great blunders. Some people are always troubled and in tension.\r\n\r\nMany people are troubled in their heart when they hear a sad news. Some are troubled when they are at the receiving end of harsh words. Some because of their anger, they become tense and troubled.\r\n\r\nAs a child of God, you should never be troubled in your heart. In the midst of your troubles and tribulations, run toward the presence of God. Do not seek favour of men, , but sit at the feet of the Lord. In the Scripture, there are so many examples of how the people of God were delivered from their troubles, as they sought the Lord.\r\n\r\nOnce when Jesus and His disciples were travelling by a boat, a great windstorm arose and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was about to be filled. The disciples were so afraid and troubled in their hearts. But Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And the disciples woke him up and said to Him: “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” (Mark 4:38).\r\n\r\nThen He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. But He said to them, “Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?” (Mark 4:39-40)\r\n\r\nWe also read in the Scripture about Hannah who poured out her heart’s anguish in the presence of God. And of Mary who chose the good part and sat at the feet of the Lord. You also come unto the Lord. Since the Lord is always with you, He will certainly perform a miracle for you and deliver you from all your trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says: “Whoever believes will not act hastily” (Isaiah 28:16). According to this verse, if you act hastily under any circumstance, it only means that you do not have adequate faith. Children of God, have faith in the Lord and He will turn away all your troubles and grant you peace."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
