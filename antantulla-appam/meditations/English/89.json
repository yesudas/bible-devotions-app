Though God had already compared His children to olive shoots, fig trees, and fruitful grapevines near the house, He did not stop there. He likened them to fragrant aloes (sandalwood).\r\n\r\nWhat is so special about the sandalwood tree? Some trees have fragrant flowers only in certain seasons, and their roots, trunks, or leaves do not have any fragrance. In some other trees, only the roots may be aromatic. But in sandalwood, every part—the root, trunk, branches, leaves, and flowers—exudes fragrance.\r\n\r\nAmong all trees, sandalwood is considered one of the most precious and highly valued. Its aroma is rich, calming, and heavenly. There is hardly anyone in the world who dislikes the scent of sandalwood.\r\n\r\nSandalwood has another unique quality: it cools the human body by reducing internal heat. Its sweet aroma naturally draws people closer and soothes their hearts.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fragrance of sandalwood is released only when it is scraped and grated. In the same way, when we endure trials, tribulations, and afflictions for the sake of Christ—when we are “rubbed” by life’s difficulties—the divine aroma begins to emanate from our lives.\r\n\r\nThat is why Scripture compares us to sandalwood trees. And more than that, it is only when sandalwood is cut, crushed, and pressed that sandalwood oil is extracted—oil that carries an even more intense fragrance.\r\n\r\nSo do not be disheartened when facing trials. Don’t murmur saying, “Why am I going through this pain? Why these tears, this sorrow, this hardship?”. In the midst of all affliction, the Lord is shaping you into a vessel of precious fragrance. He will certainly lift you up.\r\n\r\nWhat are God’s garments like? The psalmist in Psalm 45 writes that His garments are filled with the fragrance of myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Yes, on Calvary’s cross, as He was bruised from head to toe, He poured forth the divine fragrance like precious sandalwood.\r\n\r\nDear children of God, meditate on His love and His example. May you become a sweet-smelling aroma unto Him!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.\" (Ephesians 5:2)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
