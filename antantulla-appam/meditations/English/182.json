(1 Thessalonians 5:22)"},"devotion":{"label":"Devotion","text":"To live a holy life, we need unwavering determination and dedication in our hearts. When the Bible instructs us to depart from certain things, we must obey without hesitation. It is essential to separate ourselves from worldly influences, impure thoughts, and relationships that lead us away from God.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as small, seemingly harmless sins can entangle us over time. The Bible warns that \"the one who sins is a slave to sin\" (John 8:34). A single cigarette can lead to a lifelong habit of smoking. A drink taken to please friends or colleagues can become an addiction. Evil is easy to fall into but extremely difficult to escape.\r\n\r\nConsider this illustration: During a flood, a man spotted what he thought was a black woollen cloth floating by. Eager to claim it, he swam toward it, only to realize it was a bear. The bear grabbed him tightly. As he cried out for help, the villagers shouted, \"Let go of it and come back!\" He replied, \"I caught it first, but now it has caught me. I want to let go, but I can't.\" Sinful habits are much the same—they ensnare and hold us captive.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of happiness, many chase after fleeting desires, only to find themselves trapped. Like a deer running toward the mirage of water, people chase sinful pleasures, but instead of satisfaction, they find themselves in ruin. Satan exploits these desires, using them to lead people astray from God.\r\n\r\nThe key is to eliminate sinful habits while they are still small. Commit yourself fully to a holy life and cling to Christ. When your feet slip, His grace will uphold you. He is mighty to keep you from falling.\r\n\r\nNo matter how green and appealing a poisonous plant may appear, we would never consider it food. Even animals instinctively avoid harmful plants. How much more should we, as children of God, guard our spiritual lives!\r\n\r\nChildren of God, avoid every appearance of evil. Dedicate your life to holiness, and you will experience the peace and joy that come from walking closely with Christ."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Catch us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes”.
