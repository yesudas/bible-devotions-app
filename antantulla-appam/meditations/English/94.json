With a few nails in his mouth and a hammer in his hand, he worked steadily—until suddenly, he shouted, “Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!”\r\n\r\nSomeone watching from below called out, “What happened?” The man replied, “I accidentally swallowed one of the nails.” Puzzled, the onlooker asked, “You're shouting hallelujah for swallowing a nail? What’s so joyful about that?”\r\n\r\nThe man responded, “I’m praising God that I didn’t swallow the hammer! If that had happened, it would’ve been far worse! So I thank the Lord!”\r\n\r\nA godly man once said, “Even if you don’t have a reason to praise, make one up and start praising!”\r\n\r\nThat’s what David did. He began praising the Lord while tending sheep, and the Lord lifted him to become a king who praised.\r\n\r\nA certain servant of God, during moments of loss and distress, would go into his prayer room, shut the door, sing joyfully, praise God, and even dance. When asked why he did that, he said, “Satan may have brought a small trouble, but the Lord is going to turn it into a great blessing. So I praise Him in advance!”\r\n\r\nThe Bible says, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” (Romans 8:28)\r\n\r\nIf you choose to praise God, every trial that comes your way will be turned into a triumph. Every stumbling block will become a stepping stone. Every loss will turn into great gain. Believe firmly in your heart that God will work all things together for your good.\r\n\r\nSatan brought many troubles and losses to Job. Yet Job did not complain. He said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” (Job 1:21). Job began to praise instead of murmuring.\r\n\r\nDear children of God, at the end of your trial, you will receive double blessings!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The Lord lives!
