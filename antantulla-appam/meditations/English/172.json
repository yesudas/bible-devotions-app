Today, He sends His Word directly to you and your family, bringing divine healing. His Word removes sickness, weakness, and affliction from both body and soul.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast difference between the words of this world and the Word of the Lord. The words of the world lack power, spirit, and life. But God's Word is “spirit and life” (John 6:63). It revives the soul and gives understanding to the simple.\r\n\r\nThe centurion, believing in the power of Christ’s Word, said to Him, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed” (Matthew 8:8). The One who created the heavens and the earth by His word can surely send His Word to bring you healing and restoration.\r\n\r\nJesus said, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks” (Matthew 12:34). The Lord’s heart overflows with mercy and boundless love, and from His mouth comes healing. His Word brings divine health.\r\n\r\nThe Lord declares, “So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it” (Isaiah 55:11). His Word strengthens the weak, heals the sick, and revives the soul.\r\n\r\nHis Word is not distant; it is near to you. Just as radio waves travel unseen across the world in an instant, so too can the power of God's Word transcend all barriers! He asks, “Am I a God near at hand, … and not a God afar off?” (Jeremiah 23:23). He promises, “I will bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you” (Exodus 23:25), and “the Lord will take away from you all sickness” (Deuteronomy 7:15).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, receive His Word with faith! The Bible urges, “Receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls” (James 1:21). Surely, His Word will bring you divine healing."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for Further Meditation: “The Lord forgives all your iniquities, heals all your diseases, redeems your life from destruction, crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Psalm 103:3–5)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
