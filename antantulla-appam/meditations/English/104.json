That is the true Christian life—a life of peace and deep satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut the unsatisfied man tries many paths in vain. Though he keeps searching, he ends up burdened with sorrow and restlessness. Even in workplaces, many are given good salaries, yet lacking contentment, they fall into corruption. Bribes will never bring satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe lack of satisfaction also destroys families. There are wives who, despite having good husbands, are discontent and look elsewhere. Likewise, some husbands, unable to find satisfaction in their wives, turn to other women.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says: “Hell and Destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.” (Proverbs 27:20). “He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase. This also is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 5:10)\r\n\r\nSo, who will be satisfied? Who will experience true joy and contentment? The Bible tells us: “The meek shall eat and be satisfied.” (Psalm 22:26).\r\n\r\nChrist alone gives this meekness. Jesus calls out and says: “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” (Matthew 11:29). When we clothe ourselves in Christ’s meekness, our whole life will be filled with calmness and contentment.\r\n\r\nIt is true—seasons of lack may come. There may be days of scarcity or need, but God promises to give us a satisfied life.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says: “The Lord knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be forever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.” (Psalm 37:18–19)\r\n\r\nApostle Paul says: “I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content&#8230; everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.” (Philippians 4:11–12)\r\n\r\nSo, hold fast to the promise that God will satisfy you. Whatever He gives you—be it your job, your clothing, your provision—be thankful and be content. Praise Him with joy in every circumstance. In due time, He will lift you up and bless you abundantly."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.” (Matthew 5:6)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
