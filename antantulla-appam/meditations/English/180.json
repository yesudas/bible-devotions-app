We fortify wobbly knees through a fervent prayer life. We mend families plagued by division and strife with divine love. But when it comes to the inner man, nothing but grace can strengthen it. Grace alone empowers us to remain zealous for the Lord.\r\n\r\nWhen Christ came down to earth, He brought many treasures: divine love, the glory of the Father, compassion, and divine truth. Through Him, we received forgiveness of sins and the joy of salvation. The greatest among the gifts of God, is His grace.\r\n\r\nNot only did Christ bring these gifts, but He also chose to dwell among us. The One who was in heaven became flesh for our sake. How astounding it is that the One who walked this earth in flesh and blood continues to dwell among us today! Scripture declares, “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14).\r\n\r\nHe has also granted His Holy Spirit to dwell within us.  The Holy Spirit is also called the Spirit of Grace. The Bible warns of the seriousness of rejecting this gift: “Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has … insulted the Spirit of grace?” (Heb. 10:29).\r\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit brings with Him, the gift of prayer.  The Lord promises: “I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplication” (Zech. 12:10).\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul offers wise counsel: “Do not receive the grace of God in vain” (2 Cor. 6:1). Grace has been given to us not just for our benefit but also to strengthen others. Paul reminds us to be firmly established in grace and to help others do the same. This is why Jesus instructed Peter: “When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32).\r\n\r\nPaul’s own life is a testament to this truth. As he was established in grace, he laboured to establish others as well. He writes, “According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it” (1 Cor. 3:10).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, let your spiritual life be firmly rooted in grace. As you grow in grace, may you also help establish others in this divine gift."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me” (1 Corinthians 15:10)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
