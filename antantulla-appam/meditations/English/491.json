The Scripture says, at the end of the age, people will betray one another and hate one another.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason for such hatred? What is the basis of such accusing? It is only because of the lack of love. At the end of times, love will diminish. As people hate each other, as they have lost their first love. But if you have divine love in your heart, will it not cover a multitude of sins? (1 Peter 4:8, Proverbs 10:12).\r\n\r\nWhat should we do when a person is caught up in sin? Should we just turn a blind eye and move on?; or should we spread the news all around? We should do neither of this, but with divine love, we should tell him of his offence when he is alone.\r\n\r\nWe should join our hands in prayer with him, pray fervently for him with tears and turn his soul back to the Lord. Even then if he does not repent, then it is better to leave him alone. Even if he does not listen to your counsel, you should not go about spreading the news about him. Never think in your heart that he should be cast off from the church and be put to shame. We should look forward to his return to the Lord; and not expect his destruction (2 Timothy 2:26, James 5:19-20).\r\n\r\nThe Lord hates it when you condemn and make his sins known to the whole world. If someone dares to do that, such a person will not escape the judgment and condemnation of God. Apostle Paul warns and says, “Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are who judge, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself” (Romans 2:1).\r\n\r\nLook at an incident in the life of Noah. He drank of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent. His sons Shem and Japheth took a garment and covered the nakedness of their father. But Ham, the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and went and told his two brothers. Noah was pained to know the act of his son Ham; so he cursed Ham. And because of that curse, the descendants of Ham had to live under a curse.\r\n\r\nEven though Ham was his own son, Noah cursed him because of his act. Today, you may be child of God; but do not give room in your heart to criticise or condemn others.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, it is because of the grace of God that you stand and are not consumed. It is because of His grace that you continue in the land of the living. If you have to stand in this grace, then you should humble yourself before God and men."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?” (Matthew 7:3)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
