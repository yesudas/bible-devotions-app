The loving Creator walked in the cool of the day in that beautiful garden, having a fellowship with Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\nThat garden was filled with divine health. To provide for man's spiritual well-being, God planted the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden. God's desire was for man to partake of this tree, grow in life, and have dominion over life.\r\n\r\nIt was never God's will for man to suffer from sickness or weakness. Nowhere in the Bible can you find God the Father suffering from illness, nor can you find the Son of God, who took the form of man, being weak or suffering sickness. Likewise, the Holy Spirit has never been afflicted with disease, and the cherubim and seraphim have never experienced sickness. There will be no sickness in the coming Millennial Kingdom; nor will there be any sickness in Eternity.\r\n\r\nBut when man disobeyed God's word, and ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, then for the first time, sickness and death took dominion over mankind. The Lord clearly instructed Adam, “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” (Genesis 2:17). Some translations say, “In the day you eat of it, death will begin in you.”\r\n\r\nThrough Adam's transgression, death entered the world. When Adam and Eve sinned, they separated themselves from God. Their hearts became darkened, and their bodies were affected. The essence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, when it entered their veins, brought weakness, sickness, and death into the world. Aging, old age, and death became inevitable consequences.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the New Covenant, the Bible tells us about Jesus Christ: “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10).\r\n\r\nBeloved children of God, as you repent of your sins and surrender to live a holy life, the Lord will command divine peace, health, and wellness to you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
