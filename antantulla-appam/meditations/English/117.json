Today, let’s focus on the power to bind.\r\n\r\nWhen you enter a non-Christian village, there are often demonic gatekeepers — strong spirits that stand guard. These spirits block the Gospel, blind the minds of the people, and keep them in slavery. In some places, spirits of violence and murder operate openly. In others, spirits of drunkenness and immorality dominate the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Lord gives His children authority to bind these powers so that such spiritual conditions don’t continue unchecked. The Bible says: “Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.” (Matthew 12:29)\r\n\r\nAlthough Satan may appear stronger than us, Christ has crushed his head and placed him under our feet. By the Name of Jesus, the Blood of Calvary, and the Anointing of the Holy Spirit, we have authority to subdue and destroy the works of the enemy. Only when we bind Satan’s powers can the souls under his control be set free.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which you exercise this authority and power in your ministry is the extent to which you will experience victory, deliverance, and salvation of souls.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of many family problems? Demonic spirits of anger, rage, and suspicion often operate within the home and destroy peace. Bind those strong spirits ahead of time!\r\n\r\nIf your supervisor or boss repeatedly targets you without reason, falsely accuses you, or mistreats you with malicious intent, don’t remain passive. Take up the authority God has given you and bind the strong man behind it.\r\n\r\nBind every spirit of envy, evil eye, and witchcraft that tries to block your progress. Children of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, it is your duty to bind these forces and render them powerless."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “…that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil.” (Hebrews 2:14)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
