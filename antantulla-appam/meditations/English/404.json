He expects perfect holiness. The Scripture emphasizes that the Lord is willing to set before Him, only those who are without a spot or wrinkle, as a bride without blemish.\r\n\r\nThere are many who are powerless in their ministry, as their lives are defiled.  People do not place their faith on believers and ministers of God, whose lives are defiled.  There are many believers who are troubled by the deep stains in their lives.\r\n\r\nAspire for a life without any stain or blemish.  Pray to the Lord every morning, and ask for His grace to keep you undefiled through the day.  If your life is already stained, stand before the cross of Calvary and surrender yourself to be washed by His blood.\r\n\r\nSatan tries to bring many blemishes into life. What are these stains? They are worldly friendships, worldly lusts, and worldly desires.\r\n\r\nHe not only brings these stains to the spiritual garment, but also points them out and accuses our brethren in the presence of God.  He accuses by saying, \"You have given your spiritual garment, you have girded this man with Your own garment, You have put on the fine garment of the righteousness of the saints.  But look at their state now, as they stand defiled..”\r\n\r\nApostle Peter writes, “Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless” (2 Peter 3:14).\r\n\r\nMay the Lord see you as unblemished. Let Him call you “My Beloved, My Perfect one”.  Let Him bear witness to you and say, “You are all fair, my love, and there is no spot in you” (Song of Solomon 4:7).  Apostle James writes, “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this:… to keep oneself unspotted from the world” (James 1:27).\r\n\r\nWhen we walk on the road on a rainy day, we will be so cautious that some vehicle will splatter dirty water on us.  In the same manner, we should be vigilant and cautious of sin and avoid it; and keep our life undefiled.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but if we were to get stained in an unexpected manner, we should run to the cross of Calvary and cleanse ourselves with the precious blood of Jesus Christ."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Then surely you could lift up your face without spot; yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear” (Job 11:15)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
