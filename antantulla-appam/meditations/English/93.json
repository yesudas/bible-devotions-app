When we pray, we must be fully convinced that the Lord hears our prayer and answers it. Only then will our prayers become powerful and effective.\r\n\r\nA young boy was once admitted to the hospital with a serious illness. As his condition worsened, he was on the verge of death. One day, he looked at the doctor treating him and asked, “Sir, aren’t you a Christian? Will you please pray for me?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor hesitated and said, “Shall I call a pastor to come and pray for you instead?” The boy replied urgently, “But what if I die before he gets here? Please—you pray for me!”\r\n\r\nWith no other option, the doctor began to pray—but he couldn’t continue. Even though he was a Christian by name, he wasn’t truly saved. So the little boy began to pray himself. Do you know what he said? “Lord, please teach this kind doctor how to pray. Save him somehow! Please protect his soul from hell and destruction. Do not let him be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death.”\r\n\r\nThat prayer shook the doctor to his core. He realized that spiritual death is far more terrible than physical death. That day, the boy’s prayer led the doctor to salvation.\r\n\r\nRead Hebrews 11:6 again: “Without faith it is impossible to please God. He who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He rewards those who diligently seek Him.”\r\n\r\nThere are two essential beliefs here: that God exists; and He rewards those who seek Him.\r\n\r\nDear children of God, as you read the Scriptures again and again, you’ll notice something stirring inside you; faith begins to rise. The Bible says, “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Romans 10:17). So fill yourself with the Word—and let faith lead your prayers."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.” (Mark 11:24)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
