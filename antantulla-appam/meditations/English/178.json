A home filled with divine peace and wellness is truly blessed. Today, the Lord extends this promise to you: “Peace and health be within your walls.”\r\n\r\nI have come across many individuals who are abundantly wealthy—officials, businesspeople, and others living in grand palatial homes. They have numerous possessions and a great number of servants attending to them.  However, wealth and luxury do not guarantee peace or good health. Many such individuals live in turmoil, battling inner restlessness and physical ailments that make their lives bitter.\r\n\r\nWhat about your home? Is divine peace reigning in your heart and family? Do you experience contentment and joy, or do sorrows, illnesses, and hardships crash over you like relentless waves of the sea?\r\n\r\nNo matter what your circumstances may be, cling to Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. He lovingly assures us: “My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, do I give to you” (John 14:27). Invite the Prince of Peace into your home and pray earnestly, saying, “Lord, grant divine peace to our family.”\r\n\r\nWhen the disciples were gripped with fear and uncertainty after the crucifixion of Lord Jesus.  But when the risen Lord entered into their locked room, His first words to them were: “Peace be with you” (John 20:19). That same compassionate and unchanging Lord offers His peace to you today.\r\n\r\nThe Bible declares: “He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the finest of wheat” (Psalm 147:14). This is God’s promise for you and your household.\r\n\r\nClaim this as a promise given to you directly by our Lord.  Pray wholeheartedly: “Lord, let Your peace fill our hearts and home. Father, I make a covenant of peace with You and dedicate my life as Your child. Rebuke the storms of strife and sickness in our family, and calm them with Your peace. We believe You will work a miracle in our lives.”\r\n\r\nChildren of God, when you trust and pray, the Lord will surely bring healing and peace into your home."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers!
