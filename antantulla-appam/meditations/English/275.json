The armies of Israel and Philistines faced each other on that battlefield. Suddenly a giant named Goliath came up from the Philistine army. He challenged the Israelites and asked, ‘which of you can stand and fight with me one on one?’.  He did the same thing over and over again for forty days and blasphemed God.\r\n\r\nBut none of the Israelites could muster up courage to stand and fight against him.  Finally David came to the valley of Elah; and he defeated Goliath with a stone and a slingshot.\r\n\r\nWe can see many battlefields in the Scripture; some of them visible, and some invisible to our eyes.  Adam did not know that the Garden of Eden was a battlefield; and hence did not guard it.  He was very casual about it; and satan took advantage, entered the serpent to deceive Eve.\r\n\r\nThis is how sin came into the world. Along with sin, came curse, diseases, death; and man was left bereft of the presence of God.\r\n\r\nThe blood vessels circulation in our body is an invisible battlefield.  Pathogens somehow enter into our body and fight against the white blood cells.  If the pathogens win, then we get diseases.  And if the white blood cells win, then we are healthy.\r\n\r\nWe read in Genesis that the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea), was the first ever visible battlefield (Genesis 14:3).  \"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).\" (Genesis 14:1-3)\r\n\r\nToday you are standing in a battlefield. There is an enemy who is fighting against you.  He is none other satan also called as Lucifer.  He has the whole spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places behind him (Ephesians 6:12).  You have to fight your battles against world, the flesh, and the devil.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, you have Lord Jesus Christ standing with you in all His majesty, on your side.  Thousands and ten thousands of angels, cherubim and the seraphim are with you; to encourage you, to support you; and give you strength.  That is how Moses encouraged the people of Israel and said, \"The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.\" (Exodus 14:14)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle.\" (Psalm 144:1)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
