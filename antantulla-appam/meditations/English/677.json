His blessings are perfect and abundant. The Gospel leads us to perfection of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘Gospel’ means good news. At the time of Christ’s birth in this world, the angel of God announced the good news to the shepherds. It was a good news not just for the shepherds but for the whole humanity.\r\n\r\n“Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people” (Luke 2:10). Blessed are those who proclaim this Gospel, and blessed are the ones who heed to that Gospel and place their belief in the Lord.\r\n\r\nIsaiah says, “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings glad tidings of good things, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!” (Isaiah 52:7).\r\n\r\nThere are four abundant blessings in the Gospel. First proclaim peace. Secondly, proclaim the good deeds as good news. Thirdly, emphasise on the salvation. And fourthly, say to Zion, “Your God reigns”. All these four things need to be mentioned by every evangelist.\r\n\r\nThe first blessing is ‘peace’. God has promised perfect peace from the abundance of His Gospel. “You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You” (Isaiah 26:3).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the good deeds. The Scripture says, “And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work” (2 Corinthians 9:8).\r\n\r\nThe abundance of Gospel leads in a blessed and prosperous path all through your life. Christ Jesus is that Gospel; and it is from Him that you obtain peace, good works, salvation, and divine faith.\r\n\r\nWhen you place your faith in the Lord and ask Him to dwell in your heart and in your life, He will lead you into abundant blessings. He is all powerful and full of life to grant you such abundant blessings."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “A faithful man will abound with blessings, but he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished” (Proverbs 28:20)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
