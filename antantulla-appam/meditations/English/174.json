Everywhere we turn, we see wickedness and corruption. Sickness, accidents, disasters, and various dangers are all around us.  Witchcraft and sorcery continue to rise, seeking to harm.\r\n\r\nThat is why, instead of listing every form of evil, the psalmist declares a powerful, all-encompassing promise: “The Lord shall preserve you from all evil.” This assurance covers every situation, leaving no room for doubt.\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul reaffirms this truth, saying, “But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one” (2 Thessalonians 3:3). God's faithfulness is unwavering. Even when we falter, His promises stand firm: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself” (2 Timothy 2:13).\r\n\r\nOur security rests on the unshakable foundation of God’s faithfulness: \"God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?\" (Numbers 23:19).\r\n\r\nHe is “God, who cannot lie” (Titus 1:2), and “It is impossible for God to lie” (Hebrews 6:18).\r\n\r\nThe Lord, who watches over us, is faithful to protect us. Let us sing with hope and confidence: \"Do not be afraid, for He will protect us!\"\r\n\r\nYes, He has redeemed us with His precious blood and shelters us in the fortress of His grace. He commands His angels to guard us, surrounds us with flaming swords, and sends chariots of fire to defend us. Above all, He covers us with His wings and keeps us as the apple of His eye.\r\n\r\nIn this world, unexpected illnesses, accidents, and the schemes of the wicked constantly threaten us. But the Bible assures us: “The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe” (Proverbs 18:10).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, run to the Lord for refuge! He is faithful to protect all who take shelter in Him."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for Further Meditation: “And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly kingdom.
