We must decisively put away anything that distracts or opposes our prayer. If we fail to create an atmosphere and attitude of prayer, we will not be able to pray effectively or powerfully.\r\n\r\nAt a zoo, there was a strange chameleon that attracted many visitors. It had two head; and its second head was at the lower end of its body – where the tail should have been. Each head had its own pair of eyes and its own mouth.\r\n\r\nThough it was a rare sight and drew the attention of many, the chameleon’s condition was quite pitiable. Whenever it tried to move, the front legs would pull in one direction while the back legs pulled in the opposite. It could not move at all. This is exactly how some people are during prayer. On one hand, they desire God’s presence. On the other hand, they are weighed down by the cares of the world.\r\n\r\nSome people physically turn to God, but mentally, their souls are turned toward pending tasks or worldly worries. One moment they feel holy, and the next, they are making plans to indulge in sin.\r\n\r\nApostle James writes: “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.” (James 1:5–8)\r\n\r\nWhat are the things that block your prayer life?\r\n\r\n– Is it your family environment?\r\n\r\n– Or obstacles created by others around you?\r\n\r\n– Or perhaps it is the double-mindedness within you?\r\n\r\n– Or a guilty conscience due to unconfessed sin?\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, today resolve to cast away every barrier with zeal. Come to the Lord in simple, unwavering faith—and He will answer. Dear children of God, press forward in your prayer life. May the presence of God surround you as you grow in faith in Him."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “But your iniquities have separated you from your God; and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.” (Isaiah 59:2)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
