His godliness and his steadfastness in remaining blameless before the Lord till the end is remarkable. The name Joseph means “increase.” He was the elder of the two sons born to Jacob and Rachel.\r\n\r\nBecause of Joseph’s noble qualities, his father Jacob loved him more than the others. He gave him a tunic of many colours, which his brothers did not have. On account of Joseph’s dreams and also because of this special coat, his brothers hated him. Yet Joseph lived with devotion to God and the fear of God. The Scripture says, “Godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come” (1 Timothy 4:8).\r\n\r\nIn these days, godliness is quickly declining. In the name of scientific thinking, people scorn godliness. Television, computers, and the internet have crept into Christian homes, stealing away time meant for family prayer and Bible reading.\r\n\r\nIn the line of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we see Joseph as a godly man. From Genesis chapter 37 to chapter 50 – nearly fourteen chapters – we read much about his life.\r\n\r\nMillions are born, live, and die in this world. But only a few have been given an enduring place in God’s Word. Their lives are seen as precious in the sight of the Lord. Because they lived with the fear of God and in godliness, God exalted them. If you live a godly life, you too will be honoured by the Lord – both in this world and in the one to come.\r\n\r\nJoseph dedicated his youth to the Lord. At the age of seventeen, he shepherded the flock along with his brothers and served as a helper to his father (Genesis 37:2). You too must serve the Lord with all your heart in your youth. The Bible says, “Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth” (Ecclesiastes 12:1).\r\n\r\nDear child of God, be zealous like Joseph. He was not lazy, but diligent and faithful. It is good for everyone to labour for the Lord in their youth. The Scripture says, “It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth” (Lamentations 3:27)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For You are my hope, O Lord God; You are my trust from my youth” (Psalm 71:5)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
