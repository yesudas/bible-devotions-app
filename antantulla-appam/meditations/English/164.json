However, one-third of those angels, filled with pride, were cast down to the earth. These fallen angels became evil spirits, working tirelessly to oppose God, hinder mankind from worshiping Him, and bring sickness and suffering upon humanity.\r\n\r\nEven today, many diseases remain beyond medical cure, as unclean spirits are often the root cause. These spirits torment and control the human soul, leading people into suffering and spiritual bondage.\r\n\r\nJesus warned, \"The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy\" (John 10:10). These unclean spirits must be cast out. During His time on earth, Jesus frequently drove out demons, bringing healing and peace to the afflicted.\r\n\r\nIn Mark 1:23-26, we read about a man in the synagogue possessed by an unclean spirit. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, \"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?\" The spirit convulsed the man, but Jesus commanded, \"Be quiet! Come out of him!\" With a loud shriek, the spirit obeyed and left him.\r\n\r\nNo medical treatment can truly free a person from demonic oppression. While some may attempt therapy or sedation, the real solution lies in the power of the Holy Spirit and the authority given to believers in Jesus’ name. Stand firm in faith, resist the enemy, and overcome him through the power of the Holy Spirit and the blood of Jesus.\r\n\r\nSome may focus on the enemy’s schemes, quoting, \"The devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.\" (1 Peter 5:8). But remember, when the Holy Spirit came upon Samson, he tore apart a lion as if it were a young goat. With the Holy Spirit dwelling within you, take authority over the enemy, drive him out, and walk in victory!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, the young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.\" (Psalm 91:13)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
