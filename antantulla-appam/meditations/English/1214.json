While both these types are pleasing, the ones rendered by the songs of those redeemed from the earth for the Lord, is highly melodious and joyful. Angels of God, never had the experience of sinning or of being redeemed from sin. But you are aware of the great sacrifice that Jesus fulfilled on the Cross and the great price that He paid for your redemption, with His precious blood.\r\n\r\nThe experience of every saint of God, redeemed for eternity, is very unique and different. The Scripture says: “And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy. For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation. And have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth” (Revelations 5:9-10).\r\n\r\nThe Lord has exalted you higher than the angels of God. He did not make the angels as kings and priests, but has made you kings and priests. The Scripture says: “You have crowned him with glory and honour. You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet” (Psalm 8:5-6).\r\n\r\nHe has given great angels as helps to those who are redeemed. The Lord who has shown such great mercy, Is He not worthy of your praise?! That is why King David says: “Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, In His holy mountain” (Psalm 48:1). Do you want to be delivered from the hands of your enemies? Praise God. Then the Holy Lord who is enthroned in the praises of Israel (Psalm 22:3), will come down and command deliverance and victory.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, there is no need for your homes to be dark and gloomy. You don’t need to be terrified that some one has done some sorcery against you, and that you are having bad dreams. When you go to sleep, after praising God, you will have a restful sleep and you will have divine visions."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose” (Romans 8:28)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
