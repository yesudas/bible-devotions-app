When we accept Him, He is for us, with us, and within us. This is the complete experience of His presence.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States gained independence and became a republic, President Abraham Lincoln defined a republic as “government of the people, by the people, for the people.” Reflecting on these three aspects, we can see a parallel in the Christian life: The Lord is for us; The Lord is with us; The Lord is within us.\r\n\r\n“Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?” (1 Corinthians 6:19).\r\n\r\nThough God the Father reigns in heaven, He is for us.  Jesus, the Son of God, is with us.  The Holy Spirit of God is within us.  Therefore, let our spirit, soul, and body remain holy until Christ returns! The Lord, who is holy, commands us, “Be holy, for I am holy.” Let us declare with confidence, “I am His, and He is mine.” May every thought, word, and action of ours bring Him delight!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.” (John 15:7)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
