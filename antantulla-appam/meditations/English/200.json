It speaks of humanity's fallen state and the path to forgiveness and the joy of salvation through Christ.\r\n\r\nIt warns of the destruction and punishment awaiting those who reject God's word, while also revealing the blessed rewards for believers. Its verses are sacred, its events true, its commandments vital, and its words authoritative.\r\n\r\nIf you desire wisdom, read this book. If you seek salvation, believe its message. If you long for holiness, practice its teachings. Let this Scripture guide your path, nourish your soul, and heal your spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is a map for the lost, a crutch for the weary, a compass for the sailor, a sword for the warrior, and everything a Christian needs. Within it lies the key to restoring fellowship with God and the gateway to heaven. Christ is revealed as the cornerstone, the example, and the glorious one.\r\n\r\nTherefore, read the Scriptures with a thirst for understanding. Meditate on them with prayer, seek the treasures they hold, and preach their truths.”\r\n\r\nHow true are these words! Indeed, the Lord has blessed humanity with three great gifts: the Holy Bible, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Bible commands us to keep His words. If we follow them, we will experience His blessings. If we do not, these very words will stand against us in judgment. How can anyone who disregards the word of the Lord, hope to escape the wrath to come?\r\n\r\nChildren of God, we are living in a time which is very close to the Lord's return. Let us, therefore, keep His words and walk in accordance with them."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Now, therefore,” says the Lord, “Turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.” So rend your heart, and not your garments; return to the Lord your God” (Joel 2:12-13)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
