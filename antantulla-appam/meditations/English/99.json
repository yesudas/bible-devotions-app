But more than that, he needs heavenly wisdom. The wisest man in the world, King Solomon, wrote that the one who handles matters with wisdom will find good.\r\n\r\nBut true wisdom is incomplete without trust in God. There are many intelligent and resourceful people in the world who do not trust in God. Despite all their wisdom, it is of no lasting benefit—neither to them nor to others.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because genuine wisdom is seen in the trust we place in the Lord. A wise person will say, “It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.” (Psalm 118:8). In all things small or great, he will choose to lean on the Lord. The Lord becomes a shield to all who trust in Him. And those who trust in the Lord will never be put to shame.\r\n\r\nPoliticians may have great influence. Philosophers may possess deep intellect. But in the end, when they die, where will all their learning and achievements go? Their minds, their knowledge, their education—will all be buried in the dust. What will they have for eternity if they never trusted in God?\r\n\r\nThe Bible encourages us: “Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness.” (Psalm 37:3). “Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.” (Psalm 37:5). “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.” (Proverbs 3:5). “Trust in the Lord forever, for in Yah, the Lord, is everlasting strength.” (Isaiah 26:4).\r\n\r\nWhere is your trust anchored today? Is it in your money, education, property, influence, family, or children? All these things will one day fade away. But the one who trusts in the Lord will stand firm forever.\r\n\r\nLook at Solomon. In his youth, he leaned on God. He depended on the Lord to rule his kingdom. Because of this trust, God gave him wisdom, understanding, and discernment.\r\n\r\nDear children of God, just as Solomon trusted in the Lord and received wisdom, you too can receive it—if you place your trust in Him. He is eager to bless you with wisdom and understanding!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “I will behave wisely in a perfect way.
