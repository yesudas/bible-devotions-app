(Matthew 7:7)"},"devotion":{"label":"Devotion","text":"Ask, and it is our duty to ask. Even if it takes time, we will surely receive an answer from the Lord. Our merciful and compassionate God listens to every prayer and supplication and responds according to His grace.\r\n\r\nWhat do many people think? \"He knows what we need, so why shouldn’t He just give it to us? Should we really ask Him to receive?  But the Lord has established a condition that requires asking in order to receive.\r\n\r\nConsider a crying baby. When a mother hears her baby cry, she knows it is asking for milk. If the baby continues to cry, her heart cannot bear it. Similarly, the Lord is moved by our tears. He does not ignore them or turn away. The Bible assures us that everyone who asks receives, just as it is said that only a crying child is fed.\r\n\r\nThe Lord has promised, “If you ask anything in My name, I will do it” (John 14:14). He is ready to grant whatever we ask. Believe that you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen Solomon asked the Lord for wisdom, to govern the vast multitude of God’s people and to solve their problems (1 Kings 3:9). Our Lord, who is the source of all wisdom, granted Solomon unparalleled wisdom. As James writes, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him” (James 1:5).\r\n\r\nWhen the blind man Bartimaeus heard that Lord Jesus was passing by, he cried out to Him for His mercy so that he might receive sight (Mark 10:47). The Lord, true to His promise, restored his sight. Likewise, when ten lepers prayed, “Jesus, have mercy on us,” the Lord healed all of them from their leprosy.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, do you desire the Holy Spirit? Do you long for the gifts of the Spirit? Do you seek the fruits of the Spirit? Ask the Lord, and He will surely give it to you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God”.
