The Word of God assures us: “The desire of the righteous will be granted” (Proverbs 10:24). It also says, “The desire of the righteous is only good.” (Proverbs 11:23).\r\n\r\nJust as parents strive to fulfill their children's wishes, buying them what they long for, how much more will our heavenly Father—who loves us infinitely—take delight in granting our desires! At times, earthly parents may lack the resources to provide for their children, but our God, who is rich in glory, meets all our needs. The Bible declares: “The young lions lack and suffer hunger; but those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing.” (Psalm 34:10).\r\n\r\nOne morning, a man went out to buy vegetables. While shopping, he noticed some apples at a stall and decided to buy a few. As he was on his way home, he met a servant of God. After exchanging a few words, the man gave him some apples. Suddenly, the servant began to weep.\r\n\r\nWith tears in his eyes, he said, “Sir, when I left home, my children asked me, ‘Father, please buy us some apples; we would love to eat them.’ I agreed, but I had no money in my hand; and I didn’t know how I would face them when I returned empty-handed. But then I saw you, and without knowing my situation, you gave me these apples. I can hardly believe it!”\r\n\r\nHow good and compassionate is our Lord! He delights in fulfilling even our smallest desires. That moment brought joy to the servant of God, to the man who gave him the apples, and above all, to the Lord who grants the desires of our heart.\r\n\r\nOur very desires become prayers before God. At times, He grants even the unspoken desires of our hearts. Not only does He fulfill our wishes, but He also places godly desires within us—aligning our hearts with His will."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
