You should receive the Holy Spirit, who grants you the victory. And you should kindle the Spirit; and permit the Holy Spirit to operate mightily in you. Daniel lived a life that was led by the Holy Spirit. And through that, He was set as the ruler over the whole realm.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the Queen Mother of Babylon about Daniel, was as follows: “There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father – your father the king, made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation” (Daniel 5:11-12).\r\n\r\nIn the Old Testament times, it was rare to see people being filled with the Holy Spirit. But we now live in the era of the Holy Spirit; the era of latter rain. It is the season of the Lord pouring out His anointing. It is the time of operating the gifts and powers of the nine spirits. If you have to receive the Holy Spirit, you should cleanse your heart in the precious blood of Jesus and lift it up before the Lord.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Holly Spirit, Lord Jesus said, “Come!” And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely”. When you receive the Holy Spirit, He Himself will be in you as your comforter. And He will lead you and guide you into all truth. “When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him” (Isaiah 59:19).\r\n\r\nThere are two things placed before you in your life. One is to choose the sinful pleasures of this world. And the other is to be cleansed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ, and being filled with the Holy Spirit. Whatever be the status of a person’s life, he will die in the same state. The Scripture says, “His (sinner’s) bones are full of his youthful vigour, but it will lie down with him in the dust” (Job 20:11). But if you have received the Holy Spirit, the Lord will send fire to your bones, from above (Lamentations 1:13). Children of God, be filled with the heavenly fire; that is the only way to live a life of victory."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord” (Isaiah 11:2)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
