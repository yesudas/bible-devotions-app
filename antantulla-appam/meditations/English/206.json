The Lord tells us this to comfort and encourage us, but also so that we may learn to depend on Him fully.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a negative force that often leads to failure. Those who lack faith in the Lord or doubt His power are more prone to worry. When we allow worry to take over, we deny the Lord the opportunity to fight on our behalf. Reflect on this for a moment.\r\n\r\nWorry achieves nothing. It cannot prevent tomorrow’s troubles or keep evil at bay. On the contrary, anxiety drains our spiritual strength, weakens us, and grieves the heart of the Lord.\r\n\r\nAn experienced physician analysed his patients over many years and came to the following conclusion:\r\n\r\nChildren of God, consider the words of our Lord Jesus Christ: \"Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin. … Therefore, do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’” (Matthew 6:27–28, 31).\r\n\r\nThe Bible teaches us not only to stop worrying but also to replace anxiety with two key practices: thanksgiving and prayer. Read the key verse again: \"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God” (Philippians 4:6).\r\n\r\nWhat is prayer? Prayer is seeking the Lord’s face. It is opening your heart to Him and asking in faith. As the Bible exhorts us: “Seek the Lord and His strength; seek His face evermore!” (1 Chronicles 16:11).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, let us leave anxiety behind and instead approach the Lord with prayer and thanksgiving. Trust Him, for He alone is our strength and our refuge."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints” (Ephesians 6:18)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
