The greatest healing of all is the healing of our soul. When our soul is at peace, we experience healing in every other aspect of our life.\r\n\r\nDavid prayed, “Lord, have mercy on me; I have sinned against You. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.” (Psalm 41:4). When we turn from sin, our relationship with the Lord is restored, and our souls are filled with joy and divine peace.\r\n\r\nGod also promises, “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely, for My anger has turned away from them.” (Hosea 14:4). Here, we see that the Lord not only heals the soul but also restores those who have strayed. Those entangled in the desires of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life can return to Him, and He will heal their waywardness.\r\n\r\nWho else does the Lord heal? In Luke 4:18, we read that He heals the broken-hearted. Trials, disappointments, failures, and betrayals can crush the heart. When those we trust disappoint us, it causes deep sorrow. But the Lord, in His power, binds up the broken-hearted, sets captives free, and brings peace and comfort.\r\n\r\nThe Lord has given us His promises for healing and restoration throughout Scripture. He brings physical healing, emotional healing, and spiritual renewal. He restores the soul, strengthens the weak, and revives the hopeless. His healing touch brings wholeness to every area of life. How wonderful is our Lord!\r\n\r\nThe Word declares, “For I will restore health to you and heal your wounds, declares the Lord.” (Jeremiah 30:17). Children of God, the unchanging Lord Jesus – yesterday, today, and forever – continues to grant freedom and divine healing to all who seek Him."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people” (Matthew 4:23)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
