Truly, He is the fragrant Rose who fills our hearts with His aroma, and the captivating Lily that draws our souls.\r\n\r\nBut when we read this verse in the original language, we find that it is actually spoken by the bride, referring to herself. The Shulamite woman says, “I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.” In response, her beloved declares: “Like a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.” (Song of Solomon 2:2)\r\n\r\nLet us pause and meditate on these two flowers. First, the rose of Sharon—it blooms in broad daylight on the fertile plains of Sharon, visible to all, brilliant and eye-catching. Then comes the lily of the valleys, blooming silently, hidden among thorns in a quiet, secluded valley. It releases its fragrance in the night.\r\n\r\nWe are called to spread fragrance for the Lord in all seasons—both in the bright days of abundance and in the dark valleys of suffering. Even when surrounded by thorns of trial, our lives should release the aroma of devotion.\r\n\r\nJesus said, “I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work.” (John 9:4). Indeed, He went from town to town proclaiming the Kingdom of God. His life was fragrant both by day and night.\r\n\r\nThe red hue of the rose reminds us of Christ’s blood, His sacrifice, and the death on Calvary. \"And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.\" (Luke 23:33). Even in the agony of the cross, Jesus did not utter any complaint; but only forgiveness and He said: \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.\" (Luke 23:34). Such were the fragrant words of love.\r\n\r\nThe white lily represents Christ’s purity—a spotless, blameless life. It reminds us constantly of His holiness. Dear child of God, just as He is holy, we too must be holy. Among all fragrances in the world, none is greater than the aroma of holiness."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"Your name is ointment poured forth.\" (Song of Solomon 1:3)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
