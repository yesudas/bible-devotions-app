But the Scriptures also show us the many other ways He is present in our lives. Let us reflect on some of them today.\r\n\r\nFirst, He is our Father. “As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear Him.” (Psalm 103:13). Just as a father lifts and carries his child, so does our God care for us and carry us through all things.\r\n\r\nSecond, He comforts us like a mother. “As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 66:13). There is no love in this world quite like a mother’s love—and God’s love matches it in tenderness and strength.\r\n\r\nThird, He is our Teacher. “The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” (John 14:26). We can lovingly call Him “Rabbi” or “Rabboni”—our Good Teacher.\r\n\r\nFourth, He is our Wonderful Counsellor. He has promised, “I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye.” (Psalm 32:8).\r\n\r\nFifth, He is our Friend who does not hesitate to lay down His life for us. “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” (John 15:13).\r\n\r\nSixth, He is our High Priest, who intercedes for us and helps us in our weaknesses. “For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.” (Hebrews 4:15).\r\n\r\nSeventh, He is our Creator and Comforter, the One who brings encouragement to our hearts. “And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever.” (John 14:16).\r\n\r\nEighth, He is our Strength, especially when we are weary and weak. “He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength.” (Isaiah 40:29).\r\n\r\nNinth, He is the One who keeps us from falling and is able to present us faultless. “Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy&#8230;” (Jude 1:24).\r\n\r\nTenth, He is a dear Friend who walks with us in deep fellowship and unity.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, what a great privilege it is to journey through this life, with the Lord by our side in all these ways!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.” (Deuteronomy 33:27)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
