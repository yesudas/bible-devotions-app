First, it can refer to the early morning hours. Didn’t the Lord say, “Those who seek Me early shall find Me”? The most refreshing time of day is usually between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it can also mean the time of the day that is pleasing and refreshing to the Lord—a time when we bring delight to His heart. That is the time of praise and worship—when we sing and rejoice before Him in spirit and in truth. It is then that He descends and dwells in the midst of our praises.\r\n\r\nThe Lord is the One who speaks with us. His voice resounds sweetly and lovingly. When He says, “My beloved, you are Mine,” our hearts are overwhelmed with joy. In the Song of Songs, we hear His voice as that of our divine lover and cling to His bosom with love.\r\n\r\nIn Scripture, God called Samuel. Samuel heard the voice of the Lord. The Bible says, “The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ Then Samuel said, ‘Speak, for Your servant is listening.’” (1 Samuel 3:10). Samuel was only about three or four years old at the time. As a little child, he wouldn’t have had the spiritual maturity to fully discern that it was the Lord’s voice.\r\n\r\nYet, Samuel, who grew up learning to listen to God’s voice, became a mighty prophet in the hands of the Lord. He grew, and the Lord was with him.\r\n\r\nGod doesn’t call only adults—He calls children too. So, prepare your children to hear the voice of the Lord from a young age. He has promised to pour out His Spirit on your sons and daughters (Joel 2:28). Yes, He will pour out His Spirit on your offspring and descendants.\r\n\r\nIf you desire to see the Lord and speak with Him, first, purify yourself. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” (Matthew 5:8)\r\n\r\nSecond, humble yourself like a little child. Keep praying, “Lord, speak to me. Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening. Let me hear the sound of Your voice.” Children of God, the Lord will speak with you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The glory of the God of Israel came from the east.
