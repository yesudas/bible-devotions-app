Education and discipline of the children are destroyed. Homes that once stood tall in dignity now hang their heads in shame.\r\n\r\nEven among Christian families—where godly mothers have raised their children in devotion—some young men have fallen into the evil of drinking. This is heartbreaking. Devoted wives are left helpless, not knowing what to do as they watch their husbands fall into the grip of addiction. Alcoholism is a global crisis.\r\n\r\nOne family suffered greatly because the father was a habitual drunkard. The home was in shambles. One day, as he was leaving for work, his six-year-old daughter—whom he dearly loved—clung to his legs and sweetly said, “Daddy, when you come home this evening, please bring three bowls.”\r\n\r\nThe father was puzzled. “What three bowls?” he asked. The little girl explained: “One bowl for Mommy, one for baby brother, and one for me. Because we are going to go begging. Every day you come home drunk, and there’s nothing left at home.”\r\n\r\nThose innocent but piercing words struck his heart like an arrow. Tears filled his eyes. Right there, he prayed with brokenness: “Lord, I cannot quit this habit on my own. Help me! Give me the strength through Your grace to stop drinking.” And from that day, he was delivered from alcoholism.\r\n\r\nThe Bible is clear in its warning: “Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? Those who linger long at the wine, those who go in search of mixed wine. Do not look on the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it swirls around smoothly; At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like a viper. Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart will utter perverse things.” (Proverbs 23:29–33)\r\n\r\nDear children of God, take heed: “But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly.” (Luke 21:34)"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Do not mix with winebibbers, or with gluttonous eaters of meat; for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty.” (Proverbs 23:20–21)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
