Learn to pray with purpose. Learn to persevere in prayer. Elijah, though a human like us, was a man of earnest prayer. Such fervent and intentional prayer can bring great blessing into your personal life and family.\r\n\r\nBefore the Holy Spirit was poured out, the disciples of the early Church prayed with great persistence. About 120 of them gathered with one accord, continually devoting themselves to prayer and supplication (Acts 1:14–15). They denied themselves sleep, set aside food, turned away from idle talk—their entire focus was on receiving power from above.\r\n\r\nAs a result of that persevering prayer, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them. That prayer shook the Church into explosive growth. Mighty miracles and signs followed. Time spent persevering in prayer is never wasted. It is the time that releases divine power.\r\n\r\nWhen Saul was transformed into Paul, he fasted and prayed persistently for three days. He received a divine vision, his sight was restored, and God’s will for his life was revealed. The power of the Holy Spirit filled him.\r\n\r\nCharles Finney, a mighty man of prayer in Christian history, is another example. He spent most of each day in prayer. On one occasion, during a ministry trip to New York, he met another man of prayer. A deep spiritual unity formed between the two. As they held hands and prayed together, a mighty revival swept through that city.\r\n\r\nThe Lord desires to bring glorious transformation into your life and your family as well. Rise early and pray. Gather as a family and pray. Persevere and press on in prayer.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the prophet Joel, he called the people to a solemn assembly for a great spiritual awakening: “Blow the trumpet in Zion, consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly; gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children and nursing babes.” (Joel 2:15–16). Even today, the Lord is calling His people to pray.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, whatever may be your struggle or circumstance, prayer is the only key that can bring about a breakthrough. When you pray, the mighty hand of God moves. Crooked paths are made straight. Miracles surely happen."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” (Acts 6:4)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
