When they lose loved ones, they are unable to bear the agony. In such situations, some even deny Christ and turn back. Yet, experiencing the presence of God in the midst of trials is a sweet and glorious experience.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Apostle James advises us to count it all joy when we face trials. When you rejoice in your sufferings, Satan will be put to shame. God’s presence will begin to fill you beyond measure.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus Christ fasted and prayed for forty days, the tempter came to test Him. Satan’s temptations must have been intense, but the Lord overcame them.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says, “Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.” (Matthew 4:11). The ministering of angels and the comforting embrace of God are assured after every trial.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when troubles and afflictions come your way, do not grumble, nor consider them as your enemies. Welcome them as friends. Consider them golden opportunities to demonstrate your steadfast faith and your love for the Lord.\r\n\r\nJob faced severe trials, but those trials could not separate him from the presence of God. This was because he firmly believed, “But God knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.” (Job 23:10)\r\n\r\nThe assurance that he would shine like refined gold after the testing kept Job from being discouraged. He stood firm in the presence of God.\r\n\r\nLook to Jesus Christ, “who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:2)\r\n\r\n“Consider Lord Jesus who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls.” (Hebrews 12:3)\r\n\r\nDear child of God, He will take you by the hand and lead you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
