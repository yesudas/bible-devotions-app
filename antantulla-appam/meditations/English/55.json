Reflect on them, explore their meaning, ponder over them deeply. As you do this, you will not only experience God's presence but also receive many other spiritual blessings.\r\n\r\nWhen God appointed Joshua to lead the people into; and conquer Canaan, Joshua needed God’s presence. So the Lord promised him: “As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.” (Joshua 1:5)\r\n\r\nHe also told Joshua, “Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.” (Joshua 1:8)\r\n\r\nYou may read the Bible. You may even memorize it. But the real question is: do you meditate on it? It is through meditation that the power of God strengthens your soul. We should not just chew and spit out the Word, but allow its strength to work within us.\r\n\r\nDavid was a man of deep meditation. That’s why he wrote, “Blessed is the man..whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on His law day and night.” (Psalm 1:2). He didn't just write it—he lived it. He also said, “On my bed I remember You; I think of You through the watches of the night.” (Psalm 63:6)\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to meditate? Animals like cows, sheep, camels, and giraffes have a unique behaviour—after grazing, they go down to a quiet place and slowly chew the food they had eaten. This chewing of the cud is a fitting comparison to Christian meditation.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, the essence of meditation lies in recalling the passage you have read, thinking deeply about it, identifying the lessons, warnings, and blessings it contains, and then tasting the depths of the Word until it becomes your personal experience."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.” (Psalm 19:14)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
