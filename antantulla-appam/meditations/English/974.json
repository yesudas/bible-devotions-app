No nation will want to be at war, because everyone longs for peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the Second World War, United Nations was created as a global organization, to establish peace. People spend enormous amount of time and money to seek peace. When they say peace and safety, then sudden destruction and chaos comes upon them (1 Thessalonians 5:3).\r\n\r\nIt is only for the purpose of removing chaos and to establish peace, that Lord Jesus came down to this world. He can rebuke the roaring seas and violent storms and pacify them; and command peace in the family and in the nation. When Lord Jesus rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” – the wind ceased and there was a great calm (Mark 4:39).\r\n\r\nHe is the Lord of Peace and Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6). He is the creator of peace ((Micah 5:5). Perfect peace proceeds from Him alone. Jesus said: “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” (John 14:27).\r\n\r\nSins destroy the peace of a person. Sin and iniquity separate a person from the love of God; and brings the devil and the adversary within him.\r\n\r\n“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.” (Isaiah 57:21). Jesus Christ gave Himself up as a sin offering on the Cross. “He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.” (Isaiah 53:5). “And by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him…, having made peace through the blood of His cross” (Colossians 1:20).\r\n\r\nOnly the peace that He offers is complete and everlasting; and brings gladness to your soul. Preserve this great peace that the Lord offers. And be ready to pay any price to obtain and preserve this peace. Remove all the bitterness away from you, and be reconciled with all those whom you need to reconcile with. “Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it” (Psalm 34:14).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, it is important that your heart is filled with this divine peace. When it is not filled with such peace, it will cause satan to enter into your heart. But when it is filled with God’s love, then you will have peace of God, which surpasses all understanding. “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it” (1 Peter 3:11)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
