He lovingly calls us His own, and through the Scripture, we can experience the glory of His heavenly wisdom. It is an unparalleled blessing to inherit His promises and live as His covenant people.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Oman, near Salalah, lie the ruins of the Queen of Sheba’s palace. Though now in decay, it must have been a place of grandeur and splendour in its time. The name Sheba means \"seven,\" and historians note that she ruled over seven nations and possessed seven magnificent palaces.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Sheba, originally from Ethiopia, was captivated by the wisdom of King Solomon and the blessings bestowed upon the people of Israel. When she visited Solomon in person, she was astounded to find that his wisdom far exceeded what she had heard.\r\n\r\nShe tested Solomon with riddles and sought answers to the questions of her heart. In the end, she declared the people of Israel under Solomon’s rule as truly blessed.\r\n\r\nIf the Gentiles praised Israel under Solomon, how much more should they marvel at the blessings of God’s people under His eternal rule! Jesus Himself declared, \" The queen of the South … came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed the One greater than Solomon is here\" (Matt. 12:42).\r\n\r\nSolomon’s reign, though marked by wisdom and prosperity, lasted only forty years and ended with his death. But the Lord’s reign is eternal, and His wisdom knows no bounds. He is the source of Solomon’s wisdom, and He generously imparts wisdom to anyone who asks (James 1:5).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, recognize the unique privilege of being His chosen people. Let gratitude fill your hearts for the honour of belonging to Him and the immeasurable blessings He has lavished upon you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “So why do you worry about clothing?
