The foolish walk blindly into danger. They get entangled in traps and snares without realizing it. They proceed in ignorance, failing to walk carefully.\r\n\r\nBut the wise and prudent recognize danger and hide themselves. Avoiding exposure to danger is a mark of wisdom. Take Lord Jesus for example! One group tried to seize Him and make Him king, while others plotted to kill Him. Both sides posed danger. But what did He do? He slipped away and hid Himself from among them. Only because He did this, He was able to complete His ministry in victory.\r\n\r\nThink of Elijah! He stood boldly before King Ahab and declared, “There shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word!” (1 Kings 17:1). Yet, immediately afterward, by God’s wisdom, he went and hid by the Brook Cherith. That hidden life strengthened him in the Lord. And because it was the Lord’s will, ravens came and fed him daily.\r\n\r\nSome people do not like to hide. They want to live in the spotlight. They want to be seen by others, even in their spiritual activities. They parade their generosity, make public prayers in the streets, and boast of their fasting.\r\n\r\nJesus taught against such showiness, and He said, “But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.” (Matthew 6:17–18)\r\n\r\nYes, the wise man sees danger and hides himself. By doing so, he avoids many snares and troubles. Through self-control, the wise man flees from temptation. A fish is attracted to the bait on the hook, unaware of the danger that lies behind.\r\n\r\nDear children of God, the man with self-control is cautious. He remembers God’s wrath, avoids sin and its curse, and keeps himself hidden in the Lord."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The simple believes every word, but the prudent considers well his steps.” (Proverbs 14:15)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
