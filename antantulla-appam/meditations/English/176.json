Just as David depended on the Lord, so do we need His strength in every season of life. Whether facing challenges or enduring struggles, God’s strength is essential to overcome and persevere.\r\n\r\nToday, your physical strength might be fading due to illness, old age, or various trials. Yet, when you draw strength from the Lord—your refuge and fortress—you will find renewal and endurance beyond your natural limits.\r\n\r\nA brother once shared his heartbreaking story: “My life is crumbling. My legs feel weak and unsteady. I suffer from unbearable illness. On top of that, my wife has left me for another man. My children are in college, but I have no money to pay for their education or provide for their needs. My boss mistreats me, and I’m drowning in despair. I feel weak, exhausted, and hopeless.”\r\n\r\nMany face similar trials. The adversary seeks to burden our lives with wave after wave of difficulty, turning joy into bitterness.\r\n\r\nWhat should we do in such moments? We should look to the Lord, as He alone is our strength.  The One who created you, redeemed you, and shed His blood for you will strengthen and sustain you. He has engraved you on the palms of His hands (Isaiah 49:16) and will never leave you.\r\n\r\nWhen Moses felt weary from leading the Israelites through the wilderness, he declared: “Lord, You in Your mercy have led forth the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation” (Exodus 15:13).  The Lord led His people with His strength, and He will lead you too.\r\n\r\nReflect on the countless ways the Lord has faithfully guided you thus far. Who but God can sustain you through the trials of this world? Trust in His strength and do not lose heart.\r\n\r\nThe Bible assures us: “This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” (1 Peter 1:4–5).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, the Lord’s power will uphold you and carry you through to the end. Like an eagle protecting its young, God will shelter and strengthen you to finish the race. Rest in His strength, for He is faithful to sustain and guide you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit” (Romans 15:13)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
