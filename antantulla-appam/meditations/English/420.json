Our Lord is our Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end of all the words and sentences between the first and the last.\r\n\r\nHe is the beginning in the Book of Genesis. He is also the One revealed in the Book of Revelation. And He is the One who is there between Genesis and Revelation.\r\n\r\nSome stores are named as A to Z; but even there many products will not be available. Some people claim to know everything; but in reality they do not know many things.\r\n\r\nMen exalt themselves through such names. But God alone is Alpha and Omega. In the beginning God created everything as Alpha. In the end He will dwell forever in eternity as Omega. You can see that everything that Adam lost in the beginning, being restored to mankind in the Book of Revelation.\r\n\r\nAlpha expresses perfection by culminating in Omega. In Greek 'Alpha' is rendered as 'Alef' in Hebrew and 'Omega' as 'Tav'. You have an alpha: God knew you before the foundation of the world. He is the one who called you by name in your mother's womb.\r\n\r\nHe is not only your beginning, but also your Omega. When your breath leaves you, it will be an omega to your life in the world. But that is the alpha for your eternal life. And there is no Omega for that eternity. You will be with the Lord eternally.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish rabbis say that Adam sinned by disobedience. But Abraham obeyed the Lord from Alef to Tav. That is why He is our spiritual 'forefather'. When you obey God's word from beginning to end, God will bless you to the very end.\r\n\r\nApostle Paul writes, “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us” (Hebrews 12:1).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, God is the Alpha and the Omega not only of your worldly life; but also of your faith life. He is the One who initiates your faith and completes it with victory."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For this is God, our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even to death” (Psalm 48:14)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
