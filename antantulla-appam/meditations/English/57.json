Learn to associate even small activities and moments with the presence of the Lord, and practice walking with Him daily.\r\n\r\nThat day in the Garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve heard the sound of God walking, they were reminded of the sweetness of His presence. Like children who rejoice in the presence of their loving father, they were meant to delight in fellowship with Him.\r\n\r\nLet the words of Proverbs 8:30–31 describe your spiritual life: “Then I was constantly at His side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in His presence, rejoicing in His whole world and delighting in mankind.” You are His beloved child—made to be a source of His joy. He longs to rejoice in you!\r\n\r\nEven as you walk down the street, learn to be conscious of Jesus walking with you. Imagine holding His hand and walking beside Him. Speak to Him softly as you go.\r\n\r\nWhile driving, while working in the office, or while going on a morning walk, cultivate the awareness of His presence beside you. Let your actions reflect the truth that Christ is with you always.\r\n\r\nBuild new habits that affirm His abiding presence in your life. Then you will be able to walk with Him continually and grow ever deeper in His presence.\r\n\r\nA godly man once said, “When I rise in the morning, I sit quietly in God’s presence and take a deep breath. In that moment, I feel the sweet presence of the Lord filling me. I receive it as if heaven’s power and strength have taken residence within me.”\r\n\r\nDear child of God, just as the lungs purify the blood through oxygen, the Holy Spirit purifies our inner life through His presence. The presence of God leads us into greater heights of holiness."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “The Lord loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His unfailing love.
