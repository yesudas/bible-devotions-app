He should rise up from the dusty ground, and from the state of begging. He should rise from his blindness.\r\n\r\nOur Lord is calling us and says, “My child, rise up from your weariness; shake off the dust, spread your wings and soar in the heavens like the eagle. Rise up and receive the gifts and the strength, that I have kept in store for you”.\r\n\r\nWhen the prodigal son came to his senses, he said, \"I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants’\" (Luke 15:18-19). He had to rise up from the place of pigs. And he had to rise up to come near the compassionate Lord Jesus.\r\n\r\nLord Jesus came down to earth only to seek and save His lost children. Today are you suffering under the burden of sin; from curse and disease? The Lord is extending both His arms and says with all the love, \"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.\" (John 6:37).\r\n\r\nThe Lord is calling all who are drowsy in their spiritual life, to rise up. The Scripture says, “Awake, you who sleep, arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light” (Ephesians 5:14). It is because of sleeping, that Samson lost his strength. Eutychus, fell down from the third storey and taken up dead, because of his deep sleep. Prophet Jonah was woken up from his sleep and was called to pray by the gentiles in the ship. Prophet Elijah was woken up from his sleep by an angel, to take food and be restored in strength.\r\n\r\nYou have to go a great distance, and the Lord will do great things through you. Therefore, rise up from your slumber. The Lord is also calling His bride to ‘rise up’. “Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away!” (Song of Solomon 2:10-11, 13).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, the signs of the Lord’s day could be witnessed everywhere. All the prophecies have come to pass. Shall we all rise and go forward to meet our Lord Jesus – the King of glory?"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"Arise, shine; for your light has come!
