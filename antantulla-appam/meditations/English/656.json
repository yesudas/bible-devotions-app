It is wise to think before action. It is foolishness to act without thought and regret later. You should pray to the Lord to give you positive and prosperous thoughts in line with His will for you.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, “For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13). If thoughts are not right, actions will definitely go wrong; and with wrong actions, the whole life will be ruined.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you remove all the vain and wicked thoughts. The Scripture warns us and says, “For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within and defile a man” (Mark 7:21-23).\r\n\r\nHow do we regulate our thoughts and make them right? How can we think of good things? First you should imprison vain and evil thoughts. Apostle Paul says, “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:4-5).\r\n\r\nWhat are the weapons of our warfare? You can read about them in the Book of Ephesians from verse 13 to 18. Prayer is a weapon of warfare; the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God is another weapon. The blood of the Lamb and word of testimony are great weapons in our warfare. When you use these weapons, you can surely avoid vain thoughts.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in order to control your thoughts, praise of God should always be found on your lips and in your heart. Concerning those who failed to praise God, Apostle Paul says, “Because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened” (Romans 1:21).\r\n\r\nThirdly, in order to have victory over bodily thoughts, you should always fill your heart with the word of God and His promises. Your heart is a treasury; and all what you think is based on what you have stored in your heart. If you have stored the word of God in your heart, your thoughts will also be in line with that. Children of God, remove all wickedness from you, pray to the Lord and meditate on the word of God."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
