It is also called the “Song of Songs” and is regarded as a love song. Yet at the same time, it can be called the eminent song that moves in the highest realms with the Supreme One, filled with His love. This book contains deep spiritual truths and mysteries. It primarily speaks of Christ and the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Bridegroom says, “O my love, you are all fair; there is no spot in you.” A bride without blemish is pleasing to the Bridegroom. Look at Jesus – there is no blemish in Him. He is perfectly holy, without any stain or defect. That is why He could challenge His accusers, saying, “Which of you convicts Me of sin?”\r\n\r\nPilate’s wife called Him a just Man (Matthew 27:19). Pilate himself, after examining Him, declared, “I have found no fault in this Man” (Luke 23:14). Yes, in the Lord Jesus Christ there is no blemish.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but the Lord is also preparing His bride, the Church, to be without blemish. For that very purpose, He shed His precious blood, cleansing us of our sins completely. He has begun the work of sanctification, and through His blood, the Word of God, the spirit of prayer, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, He helps us grow in holiness step by step.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as children of God, we must not be like pigs wallowing repeatedly in the mud of sin, nor like dogs returning to their own vomit. Let us press on toward perfection, where there is no blemish (Hebrews 6:2).\r\n\r\nThis world is indeed corrupt, and the desires and thoughts of the people of this world are impure. Yet the Lord has an expectation concerning you: that in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, you will be blameless, harmless, and without fault as children of God, shining as lights in the world (Philippians 2:15).\r\n\r\nGod’s purpose is to present you completely pure and without blemish before His presence. That is why He gave Himself for the bride – the Church – “that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.” (Ephesians 5:27)\r\n\r\nDear children of God, always guard your holiness. Press on toward perfection. “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” (1 John 2:15)"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.” (1 John 3:9)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
