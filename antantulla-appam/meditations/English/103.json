The sea was rough, and the other sailors were all asleep. Suddenly, a huge wave crashed into the ship, causing it to tilt. The man was thrown overboard—but no one saw him fall.\r\n\r\nAlone in the dark, tossed into the deep, he cried out for help, shouting with all his might. But in the roar of the sea and since the entire crew was sleeping, no one heard his cry.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of faith. In that desperate moment, he prayed: “Lord Jesus, save me!”. And right then, his hands caught hold of a rope that was hanging from the ship—a rope no one had thrown. He clung to it and climbed back on board, unnoticed, saved by a miracle.\r\n\r\nNo one knew about the whole incident; or had seen him fall. The crew didn’t hear his cry. But only the Lord of wonders knew about it.\r\n\r\nMaybe your life today feels like that raging sea. But remember—God performs wonders in the deep. What seems like chaos is only the stage for a miracle for God.\r\n\r\nIs your boat being tossed by storms today? Take heart—Jesus is in your boat. The very storm that seems to shake you will be the evidence that God is about to move miraculously.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says: “Then they cry out to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distresses. He calms the storm, so that its waves are still. Then they are glad because they are quiet;\r\n\r\nso He guides them to their desired haven.” (Psalm 107:28–30)\r\n\r\nDear child of God, He who works wonders will rebuke the wind and waves for you today. He will speak peace over your life."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!” (Psalm 107:9)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
