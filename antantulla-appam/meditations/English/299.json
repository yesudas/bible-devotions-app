When the author of the Book of Hebrews writes about the faith warriors, he also includes the name of Jephthah.\r\n\r\nEven today the Old Testament saints continue to speak to us, even though they are dead.  They surround us like a cloud of witnesses.  Their lives, help us as great examples, for us to move forward in faith.\r\n\r\nThe saints of the Old Testament, were not completely perfected.  The Scripture says, \"God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.\" (Hebrews 11:40)\r\n\r\nJephthah was the son of a harlot.  Gilead begot Jephthah through a concubine.  So, the other sons of Gilead, hated him as he was born of another woman.  He had no inheritance in his father’s house.  So Jephthah fled from his brother and lived in the land of Tob.\r\n\r\nThere was a stain in the birth of Jephthah; and he was hated by his own brothers.  But Jephthah held fast to the Lord.  And Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.\" (Judges 11:11).  Some people are born with a handicap, crippled, and in poverty.  Some people look unattractive.  Such people should not give in to inferiority complex, but hold fast to the Lord and love Him. And the Lord will satisfy all their needs according to the riches of His glory.\r\n\r\nJephthah was one of those who received a good testimony through faith (Hebrews 11:32). The Lord made Jephthah a judge in Israel. He judged Israel for six years. Not only that, he became a mighty man of valour.\r\n\r\nYes, the Lord can lift up and exalt any man.  The Scripture says, \"He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the beggar from the ash heap, to set them among princes and make them inherit the throne of glory\" (1 Samuel 2:8)\r\n\r\n\"Those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we think to be less honourable, on these we bestow greater honour; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty\" (1 Corinthians 12:22-23)\r\n\r\nChildren of God, I have seen the Lord heaping up talents to those who are lame.  So, do not be discouraged."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh… and he advanced toward the people of Ammon.\" (Judges 11:29)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
