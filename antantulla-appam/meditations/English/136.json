It reminds us to trust in the Lord completely, knowing He will never leave us.\r\n\r\nLoneliness is a huge issue for many families.  Families are separated—parents from children, husbands from wives, because of work or life circumstances. Orphans long for love, feeling the emptiness of losing their parents.\r\n\r\nThere are others, who live among people, yet feel unloved.  They may feel all alone, like Daniel in the lion’s den, even when they live among relatives and friends, longing for love.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is: you are never alone!  God presence is unfailing. Whenever our hearts are overwhelmed, God lifts us to a rock higher than ourselves (Psalm 61:2).\r\n\r\nHe promises never to leave us nor forsake us (Hebrews 13:5). He pities His children as a father loves his own (Psalm 103:13). When Jacob fled from Esau, he felt lonely and afraid. But in the wilderness, God gave him a vision of a ladder reaching unto heaven, with angels ascending and descending (Genesis 28:12).  That vision completely removed Jacob’s fear because God stood above the ladder and spoke to him!\r\n\r\nGod assures us: “Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands; your walls are always before Me.” (Isaiah 49:16)\r\n\r\nBeloved children of God, you are never alone—God is with you always! Wherever you go, His presence surrounds you. Trust in Him and walk in His peace!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.” (Psalm 23:4)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
