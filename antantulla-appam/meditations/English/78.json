There’s nothing wrong with becoming angry for the right reasons, at the right time, and expressing it in the right way. But uncontrolled anger is dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf anger is harboured in the heart for long, it can turn into bitterness, hostility, and a desire to seek revenge. So, even when you are angry, do not sin. Apostle Paul warns, “Let us not become conceited, provoking one another” (Galatians 5:26).\r\n\r\nSome people direct their anger at the wrong target. For example, in frustration over a spouse, they lash out at the children. Their rage might even fall on household pets like dogs and cats. Misunderstandings between in-laws lead to unnecessary fights that destroy peace and harmony at home.\r\n\r\nMy father, while in college, used to become very angry if someone criticized him or pointed out his mistakes. That anger often led him to hit others. But when Jesus saved him, he fasted and prayed for days, asking the Lord to change his angry nature.\r\n\r\nHe cried out, “Lord, give me grace not to harm others when I’m angry!” He prayed earnestly, “Give me Christ’s gentleness!” God heard his prayer and gave him victory over uncontrolled anger.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to speak harshly in a burst of anger, humble yourself quickly and seek peace with the person. Ask forgiveness without delay. Doing this can bring you many blessings and grace. When forgiveness flows, relationships and friendships are preserved.\r\n\r\nJames wrote: “Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God” (James 1:19–20).\r\n\r\nPaul also gives a wise boundary: “Be angry, and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your wrath” (Ephesians 4:26). If your anger lasts beyond a day, it gives the devil a foothold. We do not know when the Lord will return. If we’re found harbouring anger, bitterness, or resentment, we may be left behind.\r\n\r\nDear child of God, do not let anger rule over you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.\" (Matthew 5:22)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
