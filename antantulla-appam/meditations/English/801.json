In the name of our Lord, we are called upon to carry the burden of one another (Galatians 6:2).\r\n\r\nWill you give your shoulder to carry the burden? To pray for the perishing souls; for the nation; and for His ministries? And when you do that, the Lord will definitely fill you with the spirit of prayer; and the spirit of intercession.\r\n\r\nIn the burial service of a wealthy man, many people offered to bear his coffin on their shoulder. His children and close relatives also came forward, as they considered it as a great privilege.\r\n\r\nShould you not give your shoulder for the work of the Lord? When many people place their prayer requests on your shoulder, you should accept those burdens as your own, and intercede for them."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Look at how Prophet Jeremiah bore the burdens of Israelites?
