This chest, tightly locked, fell into the hands of the Native Americans, who discovered that it contained a great treasure of gold.\r\n\r\nThey tried everything to break open the chest. They used large stones—but it didn't budge. They used sharp spears—but the spears broke instead. They even tried to melt it with fire, but the iron chest remained unmoved. They pushed it down from a mountain top, but it didn’t break. They submerged it in water—no use. They even used explosives—but it still wouldn’t open.\r\n\r\nFinally, in frustration, they abandoned the chest, speaking curses over it. When the settlers returned later, they found the chest still intact, and all the gold inside completely safe.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Satan uses various tactics to attack and break our faith. His goal is to separate us from the love of Christ. But if our heart is strong and guarded like that iron chest, no enemy can shake or destroy us.\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul faced all kinds of trials and persecutions. But in the end, he declared with confidence: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:35, 37–39)\r\n\r\nSo guard your heart with all diligence! It is the wellspring of your life—and of your relationship with the Lord."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.” (James 1:12)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
