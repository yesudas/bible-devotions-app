The Lord is pleased to bless Israel (Numbers 24:1). He does not take pleasure in sickness or suffering but in the well-being of His children.\r\n\r\nAs Jesus was coming down from the mountain, a man with leprosy approached Him, knelt before Him, and said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” Without hesitation, Jesus stretched out His hand, touched him, and said, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Instantly, the man was healed.\r\n\r\nEven today, most people believe in Jesus’ power to heal. They acknowledge His might but struggle with doubt, wondering, “Is it God’s will for me to be healed? Will He heal me despite my shortcomings? Is this sickness a punishment, or does God want me to endure it?”\r\n\r\nWhat is the Lord’s answer to these doubts? “I am willing; be cleansed.” It is always His will to heal and restore. First, we must settle this truth in our hearts—God does not desire sickness for His children. As we abide in Him and trust in His promises, He provides complete protection for our spirit, soul, and body.\r\n\r\nThe Bible declares: “The Lord shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and a buckler.  You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day, nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.  No evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling.” (Psalm 91:4-6, 10).\r\n\r\nThis psalm is God’s assurance of divine health and protection. Hold onto His promises, believing that He has already carried your weaknesses and diseases to the cross. There is no need for you to bear what He has already borne.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, when you come to Him—whether for healing, deliverance, or restoration—He will never turn you away. His response is always the same: “I am willing.” Receive His divine touch, and you will surely be healed!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for Further Meditation: “Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
