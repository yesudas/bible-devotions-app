In the Christian life, the best time of the day to read the Bible and pray is in the morning. Therefore, never neglect your morning devotion. There is nothing sweeter than this – to enjoy fellowship with God. Morning meditation is essential for delighting in His presence.\r\n\r\nOnce, a Brahmin officer heard a powerful sermon by Dr. E. Stanley Jones and accepted Christ as his Saviour. To help him grow in the Lord, Stanley Jones taught him the discipline of reading the Bible and praying daily. As a result, beautiful godly qualities and Christlike character began to form in him.\r\n\r\nIn time, he rose to a high position in the railways. With great humility, he once told his secretary, “I am a Christian. If knowingly or unknowingly I do anything wrong, please point it out to me so I can correct myself.”\r\n\r\nOne day, a clerk in his office said, “Sir, I have never found any fault or shortcoming in you. But today your face looks different – sorrowful. Could it be that you missed your quiet time this morning?” The Brahmin officer was deeply convicted. He realised he had come to the office without spending time in prayer or meditation that day. He admitted it and corrected himself.\r\n\r\nMartin Luther, who established the Protestant Church, never allowed anything to interfere with his morning devotion. He once said, “Some days, my work is so heavy. When the burden of work presses on me, Satan tells me, ‘Cut down your prayer time.’ But the busier I am, the more I pray; and I stand firm in prayer.”\r\n\r\nBeloved child of God, the time spent waiting in the Lord’s presence is the time you receive His strength, vitality, and power. Therefore, increase your prayer times. Increase your times of meditation in prayer."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it.
