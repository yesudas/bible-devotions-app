We will meet Christ face to face. We will also see our loved ones who have died in the Lord with joy on that day. Those who were sown in corruption will be raised incorruptible. Those who were buried in mortality will be raised in immortality. Death will be swallowed up in victory.\r\n\r\nIf we want to get up early in the morning, we set our alarm clock to ring at the appropriate time and then go to sleep. When the alarm goes off, we get up and try to continue our work. Similarly, those who are sleeping in a lifeless state in dust, will wake up at a sound. What is that sound?\r\n\r\nThat is the sound of the archangel’s trumpet. The sound that announces the coming of Christ. Those who sleep in the dust of the earth will wake up with joy at that sound. The Bible says, “The hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His (the Lord’s) voice” (John 5:28). The Lord will raise us up on the last day (John 6:44).\r\n\r\nJesus Christ has promised, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even though he dies, will live” (John 11:25). With regard to the question as to where the dead are on the day of the Lord, the Scripture clearly answers that the dead are asleep on the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus raised the dead, He raised them up as one who wakes from sleep. When Jairus’ daughter died, He said, “She is sleeping,” and He raised her up. His voice raised the dead.\r\n\r\nWhen we wake up, we will not wake up with the old body. We will wake up with a new body; a glorious body. The Bible says: “The trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible” (1 Cor. 15:52).\r\n\r\nIf those who have fallen asleep in death are to rise victoriously, they need a Prince of Life who gives them life. Jesus is that Prince of Life (Acts 3:15).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, let the life of the Prince of Life always be in you. The Spirit of Life will certainly give you life, if His Spirit dwells in you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you” (Rom. 8:11)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
