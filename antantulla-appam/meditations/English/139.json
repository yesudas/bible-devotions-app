The Lord, who sees your needs, will never be idle. He will supply all your needs and bless you according to His riches!’\r\n\r\nWhen we come to Christ:\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, “He is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or think.” (Ephesians 3:20). The wealth we can imagine is so small, but the riches in Christ are beyond measure!\r\n\r\nAll silver and gold belong to Him. The earth and its fullness are His. He delights in blessing His children. And He is our Eternal Father in heaven.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding in Cana, when there was a shortage of wine, Jesus filled the large jars to the brim with water and turned it into fine wine. His provision is always abundant!\r\n\r\nKing David joyfully declared: “My cup runs over.” (Psalm 23:5).  God doesn’t just partially fill our cup—He pours out until it overflows! But to receive this fullness of blessing, we must follow His divine principle: “Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your lap.” (Luke 6:38)\r\n\r\nDo you trust Him to supply your needs? Step out in faith, and you will see His abundant blessings flow into your life!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Test me now in this, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing until there is no more room.” (Malachi 3:10)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
