The Lord lovingly looks at you and says, “My son, My daughter, how can I give you up? My heart churns within Me for your sake!” What an immeasurable love our God has for us!\r\n\r\nEphraim was the second son of Joseph. When Jacob blessed Joseph’s sons, he gave the younger, Ephraim, the greater blessing. Later, during the division of the Promised Land, the tribe of Ephraim was allotted a distinct portion. After the reign of Jeroboam, the tribe of Ephraim essentially became the strength and identity of the northern kingdom of Israel.\r\n\r\nWhy did God love Ephraim so deeply? Because whenever He looked at Ephraim, He remembered Joseph’s afflictions—how he was thrown into a pit, sold as a slave in Egypt, falsely accused in Potiphar’s house, and unjustly imprisoned. The Lord saw it all. As the Bible says, “Blessed is he who considers the poor” (Psalm 41:1). God, who remembered the one who suffered, poured His blessing on Ephraim.\r\n\r\nLikewise, why does God bless us today? Because of Jesus Christ’s suffering, His affliction, His humility, and His obedience unto death. All our blessings flow through Christ—blessings earned by His cross, His wounds, and His shame.\r\n\r\nThink of how much Jesus was humiliated. He was counted among the transgressors. Like a silent lamb led to the slaughter, He bore it all. The Father’s heart melts at the sight of the Son’s suffering. God never forgets the children of the afflicted.\r\n\r\nHave you been humbled? Troubled by enemies? Surrounded by reproach and shame on all sides? Then take heart—the Lord is coming to comfort and strengthen you. How can He ever forget you? How can He give you up?\r\n\r\nDear child of God, never forget that in every lowly moment, the Lord is on your side. His loving hands will turn your affliction into abundance and make you a blessing. Be strong and courageous!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a pleasant child?
