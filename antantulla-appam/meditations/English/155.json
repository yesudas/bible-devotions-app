If one is affected, the other two also experience the consequences. Conversely, when our spirit is filled with joy, it overflows into our soul and body, bringing strength and peace. When Christ returns, our spirit, soul and body should be found healthy, and without spot or stain, so that we may stand blameless before Him.\r\n\r\nSatan strategically chose a moment to tempt Lord Jesus—after forty days of fasting and prayer, when He was physically hungry. He thought that attacking Jesus at His weakest physical point would cause Him to stumble.\r\n\r\nConsider Esau’s situation—returning from hunting, he was famished. Jacob took advantage of his hunger, trading a mere bowl of stew for Esau’s birthright. As the saying goes, “Hunger makes a person give up everything.” In the same way, when spouses live apart, Satan tries to exploit physical desires to lead them into temptation. God’s people must remain vigilant in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nPaul advised, “Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.” (1 Corinthians 7:5).\r\n\r\nJust as our soul must be spiritually healthy, our body must also be strong and in good health.  The Bible speaks of Epaphroditus, a faithful servant of the Lord, who worked tirelessly, disregarding his own health, and fell critically ill—almost to the point of death (Philippians 2:27,30).\r\n\r\nWhether in family life or ministry, we must maintain balance. We need to lead a disciplined life, engaging in physical activity and ensuring proper rest. Since our bodies are naturally weak, taking care of them is essential for maintaining good health. A strong and healthy body enables us to glorify God's name and serve Him effectively."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:7)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
