And what is his future victory? It is the victory over Goliath, the Philistine giant. May be the enemy that you are facing could be like Goliath, he could be a nine-foot-tall giant, and girded with all the weapons. But the Lord will deliver you and grant you victory.\r\n\r\nYou should never rest on the past victories and be complacent. You should declare in faith the future victory that the Lord is granting you and march forward courageously. Confess boldly: ‘My Lord has never been defeated; therefore, I will never be defeated, as I come in His mighty name’. In the Scripture we read: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over” (Psalm 23:5).\r\n\r\nWhy does the Scripture record so many wonders? As you keep reading them, it will fill you with faith and prepare you for your future victory. Like the Red Sea that parted and gave way for the children of Israel, the Lord will also make a way for you. He has kept an open door before you. The Lord who sustained the Israelites in the wilderness, will also nourish you and your family. The Lord who made waters to come out of rock, will also pour out upon you, the rivers of blessing. Therefore, boldly confess and declare the future victories.\r\n\r\nThe world we live is full of failures, and people think and talk about failure all the time. But, we belong to the victorious Lord Jesus Christ; we are destined to heaven, that is filled with the saints of God. Therefore, plan your strategies for victory, right now. In those days, King Saul, his commander Abner, all the soldiers of his army were so afraid and already defeated in their hearts. That is why they trembled before Goliath. But David, glorified the Lord for the future victory.\r\n\r\nHe boldly confessed, saying: “This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel” (1 Samuel 17:46).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, you also confess by faith, the victory the Lord is granting you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
