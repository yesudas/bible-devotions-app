May these reflections bring freedom, peace, and joy to your spirit, soul, and body.\r\n\r\nToday, the world is in desperate pursuit of health and wellness. Everywhere we turn, we hear people asking, “Is there a way to overcome sickness?” Many spend their lives in and out of hospitals, depleting all their savings into treatments. When doctors declare they have only a short time to live, despair overtakes them.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying: “Only if there is a wall can you paint a picture.” Likewise, only when our bodies are healthy can we fulfill our responsibilities—be it for our family, our work, or the Lord's ministry. To accomplish all these, we need strength and well-being.\r\n\r\nThe Bible reveals many principles for living in health and wellness. When we embrace these truths and sincerely claim God’s promises, He is faithful to bless us. Unfortunately, many miss out on this inheritance due to ignorance. As the Lord declares, “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6).\r\n\r\nRevisit today’s promise: “I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians; for I am the Lord who heals you” (Exodus 15:26). This promise assures us of both divine healing and divine health.\r\n\r\nWhat is divine healing? Divine healing is the miraculous recovery from illness through God’s intervention. Divine health, on the other hand, is the blessing of sustained wellness that protects us from sickness.\r\n\r\nIf the ministers of our churches across the nation were to actively teach and act upon the principles of divine healing, their congregations would grow exponentially. Consider dedicating one day each week to fasting and praying for those afflicted by sickness, disease, and spiritual bondage.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, earnestly seek the gifts of healing from the Holy Spirit. Through these gifts, multitudes will witness the power of Christ, and many Gentiles will come to salvation. This will not only transform lives but also lead to churches overflowing with new believers."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.” (3 John 1:2)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
