Osborn, who received the gift of healing from the Lord, and ministered that gift with great authority, once said something profound about faith. He said that your sickness will tell you many things about it, but the testimonies found in the Word of God will tell you many things about the power of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe question is, what will you believe? Will you believe what your body tells you, or will you believe what the Word of God tells you? Will you believe what the doctors say, or what God says?\r\n\r\nYour healing depends on what you choose to believe. If you believe what your body and sickness tell you, you will remain in that state. But if you believe the Scripture about Lord Jesus Christ, about His healing power, and take them as truth, you will experience healing. Healing depends on your faith (Romans 1:17).\r\n\r\nFor instance, imagine a person suffering from chronic stomach pain. This pain tells him he is sick. His family may say, \"This is an incurable illness,\" and doctors may give him various treatments, medications, and diets. But the Bible introduces Jesus as the healer. It confidently declares, “By His stripes we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). The testimonies of those healed in scripture will encourage him to believe in the word of God.\r\n\r\nNow, what is his situation? If he focuses on the pain and sickness, his faith will be on the illness, and it will only grow worse. But if he chooses to ignore the pain and sickness and instead fix his faith on Christ, then he will surely experience healing.\r\n\r\nPut your faith in Jesus Christ. Read the Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—carefully, and see how Jesus healed the sick and how those who had faith in Him received miracles. Reflect on these events and claim your miracle of healing.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, let your faith be firmly anchored in Jesus. He is alive today and He is unchanging. Not only that, but He cares for you and will definitely bring healing to you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “But to you who fear My name, The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings; And you shall go out and grow fat like stall-fed calves.” (Malachi 4:2)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
