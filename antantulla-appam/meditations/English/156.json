However, they often fail to recognize the difference between a sick soul and a healthy soul. They do not fully understand what it means for the soul to be alive and well.\r\n\r\nToday, when people bless one another, they often say, “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.” However, they seldom consider whether the soul is actually prospering. They do not realize if a soul is afflicted or, worse, spiritually dead.\r\n\r\nWhen we say “as your soul prospers,” we must understand that the body's well-being is linked to the state of the soul. At times, such a greeting could even turn into a curse, for if someone has a spiritually sick or lifeless soul, their physical life could also be affected.\r\n\r\nA healthy soul is filled with love, joy, and peace. When the soul is filled with praise for the Lord, the body will overflow with divine presence. Scripture says, “The joy of the Lord is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10). While humans have discovered many medicines and nutrients for the body, what has been found for the soul? The wise man declares, “A merry heart does good, like medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.” (Proverbs 17:22).\r\n\r\nThe world advises against bottling up grief. When loved ones pass away, they suggest crying openly to release sorrow. They encourage sharing burdens with a few trusted people. Most importantly, they emphasize seeking comfort in the presence of God. Suppressing grief within can ultimately affect life itself; and can lead to various physical ailments.\r\n\r\nJob confessed, “For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened to me. I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for trouble comes.” (Job 3:25-26).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, cast out fear from your soul. Let your soul prosper in the Lord!"},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease.” (Matthew 10:1)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
