He was talented in playing the bronze cymbals (1 Chronicles 15:19). The Scripture also tells us that he was a seer and that he composed many songs in praise of God (2 Chronicles 29:30).\r\n\r\nOne great divine mystery that he found is ‘whoever offers praises, glorifies God’ (Psalm 50:23). Abraham was strengthened in faith, by giving glory to God (Romans 4:20). When praise is offered, God who dwells in the midst of praise, comes down to that place. That entire place is filled with divine presence and the glory of God. Because David has had a taste of that, he said he praised the Lord seven times a day (Psalm 119:164).\r\n\r\nFor the brief period of time that we are in this world, make it the purpose of your life to glorify God. When you give a testimony about the Lord, He is glorified. When you set an example in serving others, the Lord is glorified by your good deeds.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture also gives out a clear warning in the following verse. “although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened” (Romans 1:21). Not only the hearts, but so many families are darkened, because they have failed to offer praises and glorify God.\r\n\r\nBut the Lord desires that your home should be well lit and shine ever so brightly. Let your home be filled with the glory of God and let His angels stroll around in your house. Let your house be filled with the spirit of prayer and prompt you praise God all the time. Determine in your heart to praise and worship Him all the time.\r\n\r\nOur Lord Jesus, offered praise and thanksgiving even before His prayer was granted. He stood before the tomb of Lazarus, lifted up His eyes to the heaven and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.  After praising and glorifying Father God, He commanded Lazarus to come forth. And just as He commanded, Lazarus came out alive.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, realise the importance of praise, thanksgiving and worship in your life. By praise and thanksgiving, even the dry bones will come back to life."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6-7)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
