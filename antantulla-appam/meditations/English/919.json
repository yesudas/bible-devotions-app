That is why He humbled Himself to be baptized at the River Jordan. He also humbled Himself and asked John the Baptist to baptize Him.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of His birth until then, the heavens were not opened to Christ Jesus, nor a voice heard from heaven saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”. But the moment He humbled and submitted Himself to receive Baptism at Jordan, then the heavens were opened for Him.\r\n\r\nIn some months of the year, the water of Jordan is muddy and turbid. Even Naaman, the commander of Syrian army was not willing to take a dip in that river. He considered Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel. But Jesus did not have any hesitation to be baptized at River Jordan.\r\n\r\nThe act of submitting Himself to receive baptism at River Jordan, shows the humility of Jesus. We read in the Scripture that the pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Revelation 22:1). Lord Jesus did not boast about that heavenly river but humbled Himself to receive baptism just like all the others there.\r\n\r\nJohn the Baptist baptized people only for the purpose of forgiveness of sins. All those who confessed their sins and turned away from their sinful ways, received baptism from John the Baptist, at Jordan. But John was completely perplexed, when Jesus, who knew no sin; who was sinless since inception, came unto him to receive baptism. How can he ever baptize Jesus, who is without sin? John even tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?” “But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed Him” (Mathew 3:15).\r\n\r\nAnd when the righteousness of the Father was fulfilled through the Baptism, the Father God was delighted, and He said: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”. Children of God, when you fulfill the righteousness of God, He will be pleased and delighted in you."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ” (Galatians 3:27)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
