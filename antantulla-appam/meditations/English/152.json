But because the Lord is your God, He will never allow you to be put to shame. Instead, He will anoint your head with oil in the presence of your enemies and lift you up in due time. Even if your present situation appears like defeat, the Lord will arise for you and uphold you.\r\n\r\nVictory Over Shame\r\n\r\nDavid’s Example: Consider David’s experience. He had to face the mighty Goliath—a seasoned warrior, while he himself was just a young shepherd boy with no battle experience. Outwardly, he seemed weak and insignificant. But David was not ashamed!\r\n\r\nWhy? It was because he placed his trust in the Lord. The Lord fought the battle for him. The moment the stone sank into Goliath’s forehead, the giant collapsed. David later testified: “Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them.” (Psalm 22:4).\r\n\r\nHezekiah’s Example: King Hezekiah was a man who trusted the Lord wholeheartedly. The Bible says, “He trusted in the Lord God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him.” (2 Kings 18:5).\r\n\r\nHis trust in God was severely tested. The king of Assyria came against Judah with a massive army, intimidating and threatening Hezekiah in every possible way. His faith was put through intense trials. Yet, Hezekiah did not waver! And because he remained steadfast, the Lord did not allow him to be put to shame.\r\n\r\nDear children of God, Hold on to Your Faith!  Whether in small matters or great ones, if you trust in the Lord completely, He will never allow you to be put to shame. Stand firm in your faith, and He will glorify His name in your life."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Then I would not be ashamed, when I look into all Your commandments.” (Psalm 119:6)."]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
