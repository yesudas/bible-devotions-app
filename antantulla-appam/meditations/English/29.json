I will help you,’ says the Lord and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.” (Isaiah 41:13–14)\r\n\r\n“Behave courageously, and the Lord will be with the good.” (2 Chronicles 19:11). When we commit ourselves to live a blameless life, the Lord will surely stand by us. How blessed is the experience of having the God of Jacob as our helper! That is why when the Lord called Abraham, He said, “Walk before Me and be blameless.” (Genesis 17:1) When Abraham determined to live blamelessly, the Lord stood with him as his helper all the days of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord stands with a person as his helper, what blessings will follow? First, whatever he does will succeed. His efforts will be victorious. In the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines, the Lord helped Jonathan; and granted victory to Jonathan and Israel (1 Samuel 14:15).\r\n\r\nAre you facing failure in your life? Unexpected losses? A situation where nothing you do prospers? From today, cling to the Lord as your helper. Pray earnestly to Him, saying, “Awake to help me” (Psalm 59:4). Then the Lord will grant you victory.\r\n\r\nKing Asa of Israel called upon the Lord to help him in battle. “Lord, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us, O Lord our God, for we rest on You.” (2 Chronicles 14:11). Because the Lord helped him, King Asa prevailed mightily and defeated the Ethiopians, gaining victory upon victory.\r\n\r\nMove forward with the Lord as your helper. “The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.” (Exodus 14:14). The Lord will be your present help. As the Scripture says, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.” (Psalm 46:1)\r\n\r\nDear children of God, in times of trouble call upon the Lord, and He will surely deliver you (Psalm 50:15)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Our soul waits for the Lord; He is our help and our shield.” (Psalm 33:20)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
