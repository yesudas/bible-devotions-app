It is the foundation for standing against the adversary and prevailing over spiritual forces. Without holiness, one cannot pray fervently or withstand the power of darkness. Most importantly, without holiness, one cannot see God.\r\n\r\nThe Bible declares, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matt. 5:8). Just as we take care to keep our bodies clean, we must also keep our hearts pure to experience the presence of God.\r\n\r\nHow can we purify our souls? That is why Jesus shed His blood on the cross of Calvary. Holiness begins at the foot of the cross. Even when a small sin enters your life, run to the cross immediately. Repent with genuine tears, confess your sins, and resolve never to let such sins enter in your life again.  When you truly repent, the Lord is gracious to forgive you and cleanse you.\r\n\r\nThe Lord has also given us His Word as a guide to holy living. David says, “Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord!” (Ps. 119:1). But holiness does not come merely from reading the Bible; we must meditate on it and practice it in our daily lives. As the psalmist asks, “How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word” (Ps. 119:9).\r\n\r\nA third key to holiness is being led by the Spirit of God. It is not enough to simply receive the Holy Spirit; we must be continually filled with the Spirit, allowing Him to guide us daily. The Holy Spirit leads us into all truth, empowering us to walk the path of holiness.\r\n\r\nJesus promised the Holy Spirit as our Helper: “I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth” (John 14:16).\r\n\r\nChildren of God, empty your minds of worldly distractions and fill your hearts with the Spirit of God. Do not cling to your own desires but submit to the will of God. He is not only holy but also the One who sanctifies. Trust Him to lead you fully in the path of holiness, empowering you to live a life that pleases Him."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.” (Joshua 3:5)"]},"author":{"label":"Author","author":"Sam Jebadurai"}}
