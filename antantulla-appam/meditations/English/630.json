The Lord will never perform anything ahead or later than its season. He makes and performs all things beautiful and perfect in His time.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are praying for the salvation of your family members; you should not get weary in your heart if they are not saved immediately after your prayers. God not only listens to our prayers; but also answers each one of them. The only reason for the delay, is because it is not yet God’s time. Therefore, do not stop your prayers. The Lord will incline His ear to your prayers, and will definitely bring your family members into His fold, in His time. “And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?” (Luke 18:7).\r\n\r\nThe Lord is about to bring glorious changes in your family. He wants to majestically walk around in your home, as the Lord of salvation. The Scripture says, “I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents” (Luke 15:7). And when all your family members come into the Lord, there will be a great feast and celebrations in heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is redeemed for the Lord, his name is written down in the Book of Life. The Lord will stand up in the Heavenly parliament and majestically declare, saying, “Today, in this particular family, a son, a daughter is born again. They have accepted Me, and have received salvation”. And the angels of God shall greatly rejoice (Luke 15:7-10).\r\n\r\nWhen the prodigal son repented of his sinful ways and returned to the Lord, the father was overjoyed in his heart. He kissed the son with all the love; and gave him costly robe, ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet. He also declared before all and said, “For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry” (Luke 15:24).\r\n\r\nImagine the level of joy when a blind man’s eyes are opened! How joyful will a lame feel when he is made to walk! How joyful will it be for parents, if their dead child is brought back to life! The Lord will be much more delighted when all the members of your family are born again and come into His salvation.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, blessed is the man who fears the Lord and loves His law. “His descendants will be mighty on earth; the generation of the upright will be blessed” (Psalm 112:2)."},"conclusion":{"label":"Verse for further meditation","text":["Verse for further meditation: “Their descendants shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people.
