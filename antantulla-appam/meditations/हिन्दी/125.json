Many diseases were caused by demonic forces, and when demons were cast out, the people were healed. The Bible says, “For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8).\r\n\r\nHad Satan not deceived Adam and Eve in the garden, Adam would have continued to live in perfect health. He would have lived for millions of years, as it was originally created to thrive. But sin and idolatry brought about a reduction in mankind’s lifespan.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, people lived for many hundreds of years. Methuselah, the longest-living man, lived 969 years. Seth lived 912 years, Enosh 905 years, Cainan 910 years, and Noah 950 years. This shows that God originally created the humans to live long, healthy lives. But after the fall, human health began to decline.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Noah, mankind’s thoughts and deeds had become so corrupt that God brought the flood upon the earth. As a result of the flood, the waters of the heavens opened, and the sun’s heat directly affected humanity. This led to a decline in health, and God shortened mankind’s lifespan to around 120 years (Genesis 6:3).\r\n\r\nMoses sorrowfully declared, “The days of our lives are seventy years; And if by reason of strength they are eighty years, Yet their boast is only labour and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.” (Psalm 90:10). Through sin, man corrupted his health and invited sickness.\r\n\r\nToday, it is recognized that 75% of diseases are caused by unclean spirits. There are hundreds of diseases in the world that are resistant to medical treatment. Many types of unclean spirits oppress and control people, causing them to struggle with the weakness of sickness.\r\n\r\nChildren of God, when you put your faith in Jesus Christ, you become eligible to receive the divine health and healing that God has prepared for you. When you call out to Him with the spirit of adoption, saying, \"Abba Father,\" and receive His promises, divine health will fill your life."},"conclusion":{"label":"मनन के लिए पद","text":["Verse for further meditation: “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.” (2 Timothy 1:7)."]},"author":{"label":"लेखकलेखक का नाम","author":"सैम जेबादुरई"}}
