As the Egyptians were pursuing them, the Israelites were greatly troubled, not knowing what to do.  But miraculously the Lord split the Red Sea in two. He made a way through the sea and opened a wonderful path for the Israelites. But the Egyptian soldiers who tried to pursue the children of Israel, by the same path, He submerged them in the sea\r\n\r\nEven after passing through the Red Sea, God did innumerable miracles and wonders for the Israelites.  The pillar of cloud guided them every day; and the pillar of fire led them in the night.  Heavenly Mannah rained down on the camp of Israelites, every morning.  And when they wanted to eat meat, huge number of quails covered the camp.  Our loving Lord split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink in abundance like the depths (Psalm 78:15).\r\n\r\nThe same Lord is holding your hand today to guide you.  And He promises to you, saying, “I will show you wonders”.  Even today his power has not diminished; nor reduced.  \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" (Hebrews 13:8).  Surely He will guide you miraculously.\r\n\r\nWe read of the countless miracles and wonders that Lord Jesus performed.  He turned water into wine. He fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish. He blessed the disciple who was struggling to get even a single fish, to catch a great multitude of fish.\r\n\r\nOur God is the God of wonders; and He is our Father and our Redeemer.  Children of God, to whom will He perform His miracle, if it is not for you?  Even today, He will do a miracle for you, in His great compassion."},"conclusion":{"label":"నేటి ధ్యానమునకై","text":["Verse for further meditation: \"Behold, I make a covenant.
