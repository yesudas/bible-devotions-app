        "text": "Preaching the gospel is not a choice  it is God’s command and heart beat. The Gospel carries a divine magnetic power that draws hearts toward salvation. Every preacher receives a unique anointing from God, and the primary purpose of that anointing is one the harvest of souls!\r\n\r\nIn these last days, our supreme calling is to win as many souls for Christ as we can. As the Lord commanded, the Gospel must begin in Jerusalem, move through Judea and Samaria, and reach the uttermost parts of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul declared with boldness, “I have finished my race, I have kept the faith,” because his preaching reached countless souls. His Spirit-filled writings still work powerfully today. Likewise, our Lord Jesus proclaimed the Gospel, and His words continue to save millions even now.\r\n\r\nThat same Word of God has been entrusted to us  to carry light into the darkest places. Therefore, let us preach with the power of the Holy Spirit, with zeal and holiness, so that the Gospel may shine through us with signs and wonders wherever we go!\r\n"
