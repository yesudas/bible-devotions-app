        "text": "Hesitation is a great hindrance. Many, though blessed with talent, ability, and grace, cannot progress because of hesitation. This hesitation is often ruled by low self-esteem and lack of confidence. Such people shrink back, and their God-given talents remain unused. Even in spiritual life, many who have received divine calling and gifts hesitate to move forward boldly. Their talents get buried and bring no fruit. Without their cooperation, many ministries remain stagnant. The harvest is plenty, but the laborers are few. Let us pray that this spirit of hesitation be removed from us. God can turn timidity into courage, fear into faith, and hesitation into holy boldness. Let the hesitant hearts rise and shine for God’s glory."
