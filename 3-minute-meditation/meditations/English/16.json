        "text": "In schools, students who are weak or tall are often placed on the last bench. Many times, they are ignored and left unnoticed  that’s why they struggle to learn. Yet, many world changers once sat on those last benches. Hidden within them was a spark waiting to ignite.\r\n\r\nBut God’s perspective is different. Jesus chose Galilean fishermen ordinary and unlearned to shake the world. He trained, transformed, and used them to manifest His Kingdom. They were impulsive and imperfect, but their hearts carried divine fire. God breathed upon that fire and turned them into flames for His glory.\r\n\r\nEven today, God chooses the weak vessels and fills them with His Spirit. Flesh and blood cannot inherit His Kingdom, but the humble and surrendered will.\r\n\r\nAre you feeling unworthy or unskilled? Seek God. He is the One who creates everything out of nothing.\r\n"
