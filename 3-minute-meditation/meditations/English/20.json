        "text": "Mothers are always special. They play a divine role in shaping the world. Behind every success, there is often a mother’s unseen hand. It is no exaggeration it’s the truth written in every life story. We call our land Motherland, our language Mother Tongue, and even the main system of a computer Motherboard! This shows how deeply the word mother signifies origin, care, and connection.\r\n\r\nEven the Lord compares His love to a mother’s love: “Can a mother forget her nursing child?” (Isaiah 49:15). The apostle Paul also reveals that our heavenly city, Jerusalem above, is the mother of us all. Mothers embody patience, sacrifice, and compassion. They deserve honor and affection, not neglect and loneliness.\r\n\r\nSadly, in our modern world, many aged mothers are forgotten left to bear their burdens alone. But God’s Word declares such behavior detestable. From the cross, Jesus entrusted His mother to John’s care  showing us the divine importance of honoring our mothers even in our most painful moments.\r\n\r\nMothers are the lighthouses of families. Their tears water our growth; their prayers guard our paths. Let us love them, care for them, and return the gratitude they once poured upon us. A mother’s heart is the closest reflection of God’s heart on earth.\r\n"
