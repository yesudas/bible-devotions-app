        "text": "Reaching in time is a noble practice of disciplined and godly people. They are always prepared to do what is right. Delay leads to decay; delay leads to decline. When we begin or finish things on time, we honor God’s order.\r\n\r\nOur Lord is a God of perfect timing. Nature itself reveals His accuracy  the sun, moon, tides, and seasons move without a single second’s delay. Even the Israelites journey was fulfilled exactly on the day God had appointed 400 years before.\r\n\r\nSo must we learn to walk in His divine timing  not too early, not too late. Reach out to pray in time, worship in time, and serve in time. Punctuality in spiritual life is not just discipline  it is obedience. Move in God’s timing, and blessings will never delay in reaching you.\r\n"
