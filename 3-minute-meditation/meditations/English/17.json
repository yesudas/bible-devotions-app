        "text": "Hannah was a woman of deep sorrow. The shame of barrenness and the mockery of others wounded her spirit. Even her husband’s tender love could not console her. But one day, she rose up in holy determination and poured out her heart before God. Her tearful prayer became a covenant: “If You give me a son, I will give him back to You.”\r\n\r\nGod heard the cry that came from her depths. The answer was the prophet Samuel. True to her vow, Hannah surrendered him completely to God’s service. Heaven rejoiced, for a new voice was born to speak God’s word in a silent nation.\r\nIn those days, no one was ready to listen to God — but now He had found a new young friend to speak His heart. God’s joy was great, for Hannah’s poured-out heart had given heaven a voice on earth.\r\n\r\nWhen God saw Hannah’s sincerity, He turned her pain into prophetic purpose and her tears into triumph. That same God still watches your heart. When you pray with faith and surrender like Hannah, He will open closed doors, lift your reproach, and fill you with divine joy. Hanna’s Bliss can be yours too — when your heart truly pours out before Him.\r\n"
