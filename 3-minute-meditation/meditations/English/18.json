        "text": "Slag in life is too heavy to bear. It clogs the flow of purpose and weakens the flame of the Spirit. Laziness, carelessness, or delay may look harmless, but they slowly steal spiritual vitality. A matured believer knows that procrastination is the rust of faith. When a heart is disciplined, God’s grace flows freely. True maturity is seen not in age but in alertness a spirit that refuses to drift.\r\n\r\nSluggishness is one of the most dangerous habits; it has destroyed the opportunities and futures of many skillful men. This truth echoes deeply in the spiritual realm too. King David once stayed back from the battlefield when he should have gone to war. That moment of idleness opened the door to temptation, and he fell into the lust of the flesh  a single act that left a dark scar on his life and brought chaos upon his kingdom.\r\n\r\nEvery moment counts when it is spent for God’s glory. Those who stay diligent find divine strength renewed daily. A matured one hates spiritual slag because it dims the inner light. Stay active, stay pure, and stay on fire for the Lord.\r\n"
