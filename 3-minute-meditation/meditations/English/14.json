        "text": "The Law of God is raw pure, perfect, but unbending. It tells us what is right and what is wrong without emotion or excuse. It exposes sin like a mirror shows every blemish. The law says, “Do this and live,” yet we often fail to do it.\r\n\r\nBut then came Grace the refining fire of God’s mercy through Jesus Christ. Grace didn’t cancel the law; it completed it. Grace took the raw edge of justice and refined it with love and forgiveness.\r\nThe law showed us our sin; grace showed us our Savior.\r\n\r\nWhere the law said, “You are guilty,” grace said, “You are forgiven.” Where the law demanded perfection, grace supplied the power to live in holiness.\r\n\r\nThe raw law reveals; the refined grace redeems.\r\nLet us live in obedience to God’s truth  not by fear of the law, but by the freedom of grace.\r\n"
