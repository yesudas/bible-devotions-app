        "text": "There are days when Heaven opens  not with rain, but with Divine Revelation. God does not always bless us with material things; sometimes, He blesses us with heavenly thoughts and insights born straight from His heart, poured into our spirits.\r\n\r\nEven a whisper from God can become a precious jewel in the crown of a believer’s faith life.\r\nSamuel said, “Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.” And the Lord revealed to that young boy the deep things that were yet to come. He hides these truths from the wise and learned, but reveals them to the humble and childlike. Oh, what a wonderful God we serve!\r\n\r\nLet us sharpen the ears of our souls to hear His divine voice of wisdom. Even if He speaks just one word to you, that word can become life and blessing to countless others.\r\n\r\nWrite down in your heart, what He shows you; pray for what He tells you to be fulfilled. For the word you receive today might be the seed of tomorrow’s great revival. Yes! Let us wait for the gentle rain of God’s Word to descend from heaven like refreshing dew. Wait in faith surely, He will pour it out. You will receive it.\r\n"
