        "text": "Spiritual life grows only through proper care. Just as a plant needs water, fertilizer, and a fence for protection, our soul grows through prayer, ministry, and encouragement. Paul planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. We may nurture, but it is God alone who brings growth.\r\nEli’s sons failed to care for God’s people; instead, they frightened them. The people grew weary of offering sacrifices and drifted away. Likewise, King Rehoboam lost unity in his kingdom because he chose to threaten his people with whips and scorpions instead of caring for them. Where there is no care, growth stops, division begins, and strength fades away.\r\nPaul testified, “We were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.” May the Lord raise such loving and prayerful shepherds in these days, leaders with a mother’s heart. It is caring, not scaring, that builds the Kingdom of God.\r\n“True growth happens where love leads and prayer waters.”\r\n "
