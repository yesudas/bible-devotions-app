Some exaggerate its danger, some dismiss it, and others bury their heads in the sand like ostriches pretending nothing is happening.\r\n\r\nPeople stay awake for cosmic news, but sleep through divine truth. They study the stars, but ignore the Bright and Morning Star. Many expect a rock from space, but forget the Rock of Ages who promised, “I will come again.”\r\n\r\nHow sad that even believers have lost the eagerness for Christ’s return no discussions, no research, no expectation! The enemy has cleverly turned human attention toward the sky but away from the Savior.\r\n\r\nBeloved, let us shift our focus. His coming is far more certain than any comet’s orbit. Let us live sanctified, purified, and gloriously ready for His return. The media may not announce it  but we must proclaim it: “Jesus is coming soon!”\r\n"
