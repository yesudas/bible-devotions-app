        "text": "Sometimes, we cannot hear clearly  not because God is silent, but because something blocks our hearing.\r\n\r\nJust as wax clogs our ears and makes our hearing, dull, sin, wrong motives, laziness, prayerlessness, and Satan\u2019s hidden traps clog our spiritual ears.\r\nWhen this happens, we may still be in ministry, worship, or fellowship  but our inner ear has gone mute to the voice of God.\r\n\r\nIn physical life, an ENT specialist clears the wax and restores hearing. Likewise, the Holy Spirit examines our hearts and removes what hinders us.\r\nIn the hill country, when fog covers the car\u2019s windshield, the wipers and fog lights help restore visibility. So also, repentance, humility, and prayer clear our spiritual fog and bring back divine clarity.\r\n\r\nSome believers ignore this clogging. Over time, they lose not just sensitivity but spiritual hearing itself. God longs to speak  but He won\u2019t shout over our sin. We must first clear the channel before we can truly hear."
