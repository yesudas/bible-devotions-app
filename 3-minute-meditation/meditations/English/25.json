        "text": "Every believer’s life is a spiritual journey. God has graciously given us a divine navigation system  His GPS (God’s Positional System)  the guidance of the Holy Spirit, who directs our steps with perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nBut Satan, like a hacker performing GPS Spoofing, sends false spiritual signals to confuse and mislead believers. In the cyber world, GPS spoofing is a malicious attack that causes devices to display the wrong location, direction, and timing  leading to disaster. Likewise, the enemy attacks our thoughts and spirit, giving us wrong feelings, false revelations, and deceptive desires.\r\n\r\nAdam and David both lost direction for a while. Even Jesus was tempted by Satan  but He triumphed through the Word of God.\r\n\r\nWhen prayer, the Word, and spiritual alertness are weakened, our navigation drifts off course. So, be vigilant in prayer, steadfast in faith, and obedient in your walk. Let your feet stand firm upon the Rock of Ages  Jesus Christ, and be guided by His eternal Word and the Holy Spirit.\r\n"
