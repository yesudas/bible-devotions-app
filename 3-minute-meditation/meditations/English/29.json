        "text": "The eagle is known for its powerful wings and extraordinary eyesight. It can spot even the smallest creature from a great distance. The Bible uses the eagle to symbolize spiritual strength, renewed energy, and divine vision especially for those who wait on God.\r\n\r\nWe, too, have two wings in our spiritual life:\r\nBible Reading and Prayer Life. When these two wings are strong and balanced, our spiritual flight becomes steady and victorious.\r\n\r\nWhen an eagle flies high, its vision becomes clear. Likewise, when we pray and read God’s Word with reverence, our perspective changes. Problems look smaller, decisions become clearer, and temptations lose their power. Spiritual altitude brings spiritual clarity.\r\nLet us strengthen both wings. Let us fly above the noise of the world. Let us rise like the eagle!\r\n"
