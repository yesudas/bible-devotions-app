        "text": "A lifeless man never breathes  his breath has departed, and life has ceased. A man breathes because he is alive. Think about this in your spiritual life: a spiritual man’s life is not in the breath of his nostrils but in his prayer.\r\n\r\nPrayer is the breathing of the soul. A praying Christian never forgets to pray; it becomes as natural to him as breathing. Through prayer, he draws the life-giving air of the Holy Spirit, who indwells in him. The Holy Spirit becomes his life-force, comforter, and guide. Every act and thought is engraved by the Almighty within him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Holy Spirit breathes through a man, his words, his work, and his worship all carry divine fragrance. He lives not by his own strength but through this continual spiritual breathing.\r\n\r\nGod is at work in him shaping, empowering, and revealing wonders. Are you breathing the breath of Christ’s Spirit today?"
