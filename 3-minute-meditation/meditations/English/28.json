        "text": "A spiritual person always seeks God  asking, “Which way should I go?” and “When should I move?” He fully trusts and walks depending on the Lord. Lot looked at the fertile land of Sodom with his Carnal eyes. He didn’t pray or seek God’s direction before deciding. But David, in every step, asked God , “What should I do?” and “How should I go?” Therefore, he succeeded.\r\nSaul, however, when he lost his relationship with God, sought help from a witch to know his way. The result  Saul died a tragic death on Mount Gilboa.\r\nEven today, Satan approaches us with hidden tricks. He uses our pride, innocence, and ignorance to mislead us. This world is filled with lies and magical traps crafted by Satan. Every temptation and deceiving situation is shaped by evil spirits and demonic powers to make us fall.\r\n\r\nSo, we must live with spiritual wisdom and alertness, ready to overcome the enemy’s witchcraft and deception. Otherwise, we may get trapped and bewitched by his schemes. The devil can even use our own hands to blind our eyes.\r\nTherefore, we must guard our ways carefully and stay close to God’s voice.\r\n"
