        "text": "Some people shine in personality but fail in purpose. They are disciplined, respectable, and admired yet their ministry lacks the heart of Christ. They guide, but not with grace. They speak truth, but without love. They demand loyalty, but not liberty.\r\n\r\nThey become good examples of what a bad ministry looks like — impressive in the flesh, but empty in the Spirit.\r\n\r\nA true ministry gives freedom, not fear. It builds others, not buries their zeal. God never called us to control His people, but to serve them. When someone’s ministry silences the passion of others, they unknowingly stand against the work of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nJesus said, “Whoever wants to be first must be your servant.” (Mark 9:35). Ministry is not about position, but submission. When we walk humbly, even quietly, the fragrance of Christ flows — that’s the mark of a good ministry."
