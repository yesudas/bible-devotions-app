The enemy is roaring like a lion, ready to devour anyone who delays their surrender.\r\n\r\nAre you still waiting, planning, or postponing your decision? Remember Felix, the Roman governor who trembled when Paul spoke about righteousness and judgment \u2014 yet said, \u201cGo away for now; when I find a convenient time, I will call for you.\u201d That convenient time never came.\r\n\r\nThe Bible warns:\r\n\u201cNow is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation.\u201d \u2013 2 Corinthians 6:2\r\n\r\nTomorrow is never guaranteed. Delay is the devil\u2019s most effective trap. He has ages of experience in deceiving hearts. You may think you can escape later, but every delay draws you closer to danger.\r\n\r\nGod is waiting with open arms not to condemn, but to embrace. His mercy is still flowing; His grace still calling. When God speaks, don\u2019t reason or hesitate simply say, \u201cYes, Lord.\u201d That one word can change your eternity."
