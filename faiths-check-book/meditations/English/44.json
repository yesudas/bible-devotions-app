        "text": "So was Isaac blessed when he walked therein at eventide to meditate. How often has the Lord met us when we have been alone! The hedges and the trees can bear witness to our joy. We look for such blessedness again.\n\nSo was Boaz blessed when he reaped his harvest, and his workmen met him with benedictions. May the Lord prosper all who drive the plow! Every farmer may urge this promise with God, if indeed he obeys the voice of the Lord God.\n\nWe go to the field to labor as father Adam did; and since the curse fell on the soil through the sin of Adam the first, it is a great comfort to find a blessing through Adam the second,\n\nWe go to the field for exercise, and we are happy in the belief that the Lord will bless that exercise and give us health, which we will use to His glory.\n\nWe go to the field to study nature, and there is nothing in a knowledge of the visible creation which may not be sanctified to the highest uses by the divine benediction.\n\nWe have at last to go to the field to bury our dead; yea, others will in their turn take us to Godâ€™s acre in the field. But we are blessed, whether weeping at the tomb or sleeping in it."
