No good word of His has ever failed, and I am sure that none shall ever fall to the ground.\n\nI put myself into His hand for guidance. I know not the way that I should choose: the Lord shall choose mine inheritance for me. I need counsel and advice; for my duties are intricate, and my condition is involved… The counsel of the infallible God I seek in preference to my own judgment or the advice of friends…\n\nSoon the end will come: a few more years and I must depart out of this world unto the Father. My Lord will be near my bed. He will meet me at heaven’s gate: He will welcome me to the gloryland. I shall not be a stranger in heaven: my own God and Father will receive me to its endless bliss.\n\nGlory be to Him who\n\nWill guide me here,\n\nAnd receive me hereafter. Amen."
