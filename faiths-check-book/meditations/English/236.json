        "text": "Wisdom loves her lovers and seeks her seekers. He is already wise who seeks to be wise, and he has almost found wisdom who diligently seeks her. What is true of wisdom in general is specially true of wisdom embodied in our Lord Jesus. Him we are to love and to seek, and in return we shall enjoy His love and find Himself.\n\nOur business is to seek Jesus early in life. Happy are the young whose morning is spent with Jesus! It is never too soon to seek the Lord Jesus. Early seekers make certain finders. We should seek Him early by diligence. Thriving tradesmen are early risers, and thriving saints seek Jesus eagerly. Those who find Jesus to their enrichment give their hearts to seeking Him. We must seek Him first, and thus earliest. Above all things Jesus. Jesus first and nothing else even as a bad second.\n\nThe blessing is that He will be found. He reveals Himself more and more clearly to our searchâ€¦. Happy men who seek One who, when He is found, remains with them forever, a treasure growingly precious to their hearts and understandings.\n\nLord Jesus, I have found Thee; be found of me to an unutterable degree of joyous satisfaction."
