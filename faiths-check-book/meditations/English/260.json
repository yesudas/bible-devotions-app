        "text": "Well, I can do as much as that. I can do a kind act toward the Lord’s servant. The Lord knows I love them all and would count it an honor to wash their feet. For the sake of their Master, I love the disciples.\n\nHow gracious of the Lord to mention so insignificant an action—”to give to drink a cup of cold water only”! This I can do, however poor: this I may do, however lowly: this I will do right cheerfully. This, which seems so little, the Lord notices—notices when done to the least of His followers. Evidently it is not the cost, nor the skill, nor the quantity, that He looks at, but the motive: that which we do to a disciple, because he is a disciple, his Lord observes and recompenses. He does not reward us for the merit of what we do but according to His riches of His grace.\n\nI give a cup of cold water, and He makes me to drink of living water. I give to one of His little ones, and He treats me as one of them. Jesus finds an apology for His liberality in that which His grace has led me to do, and He says, “He shall in no wise lose his reward.”"
