None can find out a single person whom God has forsaken after having revealed Himself savingly to him.\n\nThis grand truth is mentioned in the psalm to cheer the heart of the afflicted. The Lord chastens His own; but He never forsakes them. The result of the double work of the law and the rod is our instruction, and the fruit of that instruction is a quieting of spirit, a sobriety of mind, out of which comes rest. The ungodly are let alone till the pit is digged into which they will fall and be taken; but the godly are sent to school to be prepared for their glorious destiny hereafter. Judgment will return and finish its work upon the rebels, but it will equally return to vindicate the sincere and godly. Hence we may bear the rod of chastisement with calm submission; it means not anger, but love.\n\nGod may chasten and correct,\n\nBut He never can neglect;\n\nMay in faithfulness reprove,\n\nBut He neâ€™er can cease to love."
