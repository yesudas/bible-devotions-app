Not only will He charge His angels to keep us, but He Himself will preserve our goings.\n\nHe will keep our feet from falling so that we do not defile our garments, wound our souls, and cause the enemy to blaspheme.\n\nHe will keep our feet from wandering so that we do not go into paths of error, or ways of folly, or courses of the worldâ€™s custom.\n\nHe will keep our feet from swelling through weariness, or blistering because of the roughness and length of the way.\n\nHe will keep our feet from wounding: our shoes shall be iron and brass so that even though we tread on the edge of the sword, or on deadly serpents, we shall not bleed or be poisoned.\n\nHe will also pluck our feet out of the net. We shall not be entangled by the deceit of our malicious and crafty foes.\n\nWith such a promise as this, let us run without weariness and walk without fear. He who keeps our feet will do it effectually."
